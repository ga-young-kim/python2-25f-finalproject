<paragraph id="H78BF17A80A2D4B1AB5A990535E35AED2"><enum>(1)</enum><text>A growing body of evidence demonstrates that gun dealers’ sales practices affect the probability of guns getting to criminals and that policies designed to hold gun sellers accountable can curtail the diversion of guns to criminals.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H379C7677AC70417B81B63F19142AC63A"><enum>(2)</enum><text>Federal laws governing firearm dealers have not been updated in over 30 years, contain safeguards that protect dealers who engage in illegal practices from adverse enforcement action, frustrate law enforcement efforts to curb gun trafficking and violence and are, thus, inadequate to meet the realities of the twenty-first century.</text></paragraph>
<paragraph id="H02DC6A8065044BA7B93833F9281C1C96"><enum>(3)</enum><text>The Tiahrt Amendments, for one, severely limit the authority of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) to disclose crime gun trace data to the public, prevent the collection of valuable information, and the establishment of effective policies to prevent illegal guns from being used in crimes and impede enforcement of the gun laws by requiring most background check records to be destroyed within 24 hours, and by barring the Government from requiring annual inventory audits by owners of gun shops. Repealing the Tiahrt Amendments would support law enforcement efforts and give the public vital information needed to craft the most effective policies against illegal guns.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="HF67840F80E58417DBEA7B5C584419CA0"><enum>(4)</enum><text>Additionally, Federal law imposes no requirements that dealers physically secure their highly valuable and lethal inventory. The number of gun thefts from licensed gun dealers has increased more than the number from any other source. Between 2013 and 2017, the number of firearms stolen in gun-dealer burglaries more than doubled and the number of firearms stolen in gun-dealer robberies tripled.</text></paragraph></section>
