Members of the Armed Forces were warned of this policy and aware that their fellow servicemen could be at risk.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H8F78C9FE10A54FE28EF9416C87C88B20"><enum>(5)</enum><text>As the senior noncommissioned officer in Stalag IX–A, Master Sergeant Edmonds was responsible for 1,275 members of the Armed Forces at the camp.

The U.S. Army’s standing command to its ranking officers in POW camps is that you resist the enemy and care for the safety of your men to the greatest extent possible. Master Sergeant Edmonds, at the risk of his immediate death, defied the Germans with the unexpected consequences that the Jewish prisoners were saved</quote>.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H761B3EA45C334E7C839BAB0F4D7E4CFB"><enum>(11)</enum><text>Edmonds survived 100 days in captivity and returned home after the war.
