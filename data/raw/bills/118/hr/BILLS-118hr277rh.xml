Section 1 of article I of the United States Constitution grants all legislative powers to Congress. Over time, Congress has excessively delegated its constitutional charge while failing to conduct appropriate oversight and retain accountability for the content of the laws it passes. By requiring a vote in Congress, the REINS Act will result in more carefully drafted and detailed legislation, an improved regulatory process, and a legislative branch that is truly accountable to the American people for the laws imposed upon them.</text></section><section id="H2AAC3F8319F54A4DB5064775CB918AF6"><enum>3.</enum><header>Congressional review of agency rulemaking</header><text display-inline="no-display-inline"><external-xref legal-doc="usc-chapter" parsable-cite="usc-chapter/5/8">Chapter 8</external-xref> of title 5, United States Code, is amended to read as follows:</text><quoted-block display-inline="no-display-inline" id="HC364E26AA7D24DCA8EF245FD201B02D4" style="USC" changed="added" reported-display-style="italic" committee-id="HJU00"><chapter commented="no" id="H18A18D57A5414678BE16E2A3F6B32D40" level-type="subsequent"><enum>8</enum><header display-inline="yes-display-inline">Congressional Review of Agency Rulemaking</header><toc container-level="chapter-container" lowest-bolded-level="division-lowest-bolded" lowest-level="section" quoted-block="no-quoted-block" regeneration="yes-regeneration"><toc-entry bold="off" level="section">Sec. </toc-entry><toc-entry bold="off" level="section">801.
