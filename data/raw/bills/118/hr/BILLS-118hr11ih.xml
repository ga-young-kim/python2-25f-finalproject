Congress enacts the <short-title>Freedom to Vote Act</short-title> pursuant to this broad authority, including but not limited to the following:</text> <paragraph id="H219F14C2FAA24E6BAD0F34A04D1DFC19"><enum>(1)</enum><text>Congress finds that it has broad authority to regulate the time, place, and manner of congressional elections under the Elections Clause of the Constitution, article I, section 4, clause 1. The Supreme Court has affirmed that the <quote>substantive scope</quote> of the Elections Clause is <quote>broad</quote>; that <quote>Times, Places, and Manner</quote> are <quote>comprehensive words which embrace authority to provide for a complete code for congressional elections</quote>; and <quote>[t]he power of Congress over the Times, Places and Manner of congressional elections is paramount, and may be exercised at any time, and to any extent which it deems expedient; and so far as it is exercised, and no farther, the regulations effected supersede those of the State which are inconsistent therewith</quote>. Arizona v. Inter Tribal Council of Arizona, 570 U.S. 1, 8–9 (2013) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Indeed, <quote>Congress has plenary and paramount jurisdiction over the whole subject</quote> of congressional elections, Ex parte Siebold, 100 U.S. (10 Otto) 371, 388 (1879), and this power <quote>may be exercised as and when Congress sees fit</quote>, and <quote>so far as it extends and conflicts with the regulations of the State, necessarily supersedes them</quote>. Id. at 384. Among other things, Congress finds that the Elections Clause was intended to <quote>vindicate the people’s right to equality of representation in the House</quote>. Wesberry v. Sanders, 376 U.S. 1, 16 (1964), and to address partisan gerrymandering, Rucho v. Common Cause, 139 S. Ct. 2484 (2019).</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="HBAAEB1C3168F4E1889A30AFDB6BA359F"><enum>(2)</enum><text>Congress also finds that it has both the authority and responsibility, as the legislative body for the United States, to fulfill the promise of article IV, section 4, of the Constitution, which states: <quote>The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government[.]</quote>. Congress finds that its authority and responsibility to enforce the Guarantee Clause is clear given that Federal courts have not enforced this clause because they understood that its enforcement is committed to Congress by the Constitution.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="HCC94ED47687B4F0E847E54FA20E42123"><enum>(3)</enum> <subparagraph commented="no" display-inline="yes-display-inline" id="H6C88460A64A544B1BFF1CAD89E7807CE"><enum>(A)</enum><text>Congress also finds that it has broad authority pursuant to section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to legislate to enforce the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment, including its protections of the right to vote and the democratic process.</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph id="HC69726179A314FCBA799579DB2DA0782" indent="up1"><enum>(B)</enum><text>Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment protects the fundamental right to vote, which is <quote>of the most fundamental significance under our constitutional structure</quote>. Ill. Bd. of Election v. Socialist Workers Party, 440 U.S. 173, 184 (1979); see United States v. Classic, 313 U.S. 299 (1941) (<quote>Obviously included within the right to choose, secured by the Constitution, is the right of qualified voters within a State to cast their ballots and have them counted . . .</quote>). As the Supreme Court has repeatedly affirmed, the right to vote is <quote>preservative of all rights</quote>, Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356, 370 (1886). Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment also protects the right to vote, granting Congress additional authority to reduce a State’s representation in Congress when the right to vote is abridged or denied.</text></subparagraph> <subparagraph id="H1F07DE7464B542FA84EFB2898D05A57A" indent="up1"><enum>(C)</enum><text>As a result, Congress finds that it has the authority pursuant to section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to protect the right to vote. Congress also finds that States and localities have eroded access to the right to vote through restrictions on the right to vote including excessively onerous voter identification requirements, burdensome voter registration procedures, voter purges, limited and unequal access to voting by mail, polling place closures, unequal distribution of election resources, and other impediments.</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph id="HBFF8AB1344644EE3B4F3B1EEC962AD05" indent="up1"><enum>(D)</enum><text>Congress also finds that <quote>the right of suffrage can be denied by a debasement or dilution of the weight of a citizen’s vote just as effectively as by wholly prohibiting the free exercise of the franchise</quote>. Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 555 (1964). Congress finds that the right of suffrage has been so diluted and debased by means of gerrymandering of districts. Congress finds that it has authority pursuant to section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to remedy this debasement.</text></subparagraph></paragraph> <paragraph id="HB6E34096A17943AE8A1947803404032E"><enum>(4)</enum> <subparagraph commented="no" display-inline="yes-display-inline" id="HD57EC2BC7E4642828A2A23BD9F9E8CA5"><enum>(A)</enum><text>Congress also finds that it has authority to legislate to eliminate racial discrimination in voting and the democratic process pursuant to both section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, which grants equal protection of the laws, and section 2 of the Fifteenth Amendment, which explicitly bars denial or abridgment of the right to vote on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph id="H5BFE843AD9774A2891B67A9D11E47B30" indent="up1"><enum>(B)</enum><text>Congress finds that racial discrimination in access to voting and the political process persists. Voting restrictions, redistricting, and other electoral practices and processes continue to disproportionately impact communities of color in the United States and do so as a result of both intentional racial discrimination, structural racism, and the ongoing structural socioeconomic effects of historical racial discrimination.</text></subparagraph> <subparagraph id="H59CFCF8EDD0A41008EDC760604371E04" indent="up1"><enum>(C)</enum><text>Recent elections and studies have shown that minority communities wait longer in lines to vote, are more likely to have their mail ballots rejected, continue to face intimidation at the polls, are more likely to be disenfranchised by voter purges, and are disproportionately burdened by excessively onerous voter identification and other voter restrictions. Research shows that communities of color are more likely to face nearly every barrier to voting than their white counterparts.</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph id="HB4AC227A960A40DD801A49AA1C5E825F" indent="up1"><enum>(D)</enum><text>Congress finds that racial disparities in disenfranchisement due to past felony convictions is particularly stark. In 2022, according to the Sentencing Project, an estimated 4,600,000 Americans could not vote due to a felony conviction. One in 19 African Americans of voting age is disenfranchised, a rate 3.5 times greater than that of non-African Americans. In eight States—Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Kentucky, Mississippi, South Dakota, Tennessee, and Virginia—more than one in ten African Americans is disenfranchised, nearly twice the national average for African Americans. Congress finds that felony disenfranchisement was one of the tools of intentional racial discrimination during the Jim Crow era. Congress further finds that current racial disparities in felony disenfranchisement are linked to this history of voter suppression, structural racism in the criminal justice system, and ongoing effects of historical discrimination.</text></subparagraph></paragraph> <paragraph id="H6D91AAE5857D455BB45E773A672A422B"><enum>(5)</enum> <subparagraph commented="no" display-inline="yes-display-inline" id="H3ABB979EED3E472A8A654DB9471E2128"><enum>(A)</enum><text>Congress finds that it further has the power to protect the right to vote from denial or abridgment on account of sex, age, or ability to pay a poll tax or other tax pursuant to the Nineteenth, Twenty-Fourth, and Twenty-Sixth Amendments.</text></subparagraph>

Two States (Maine and Vermont) and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico do not disenfranchise individuals with criminal convictions at all. In 2020, the District of Columbia re-enfranchised its citizens who are under the supervision of the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Twenty-five States disenfranchise certain individuals on felony probation or parole. During 2023, lawmakers in Minnesota and New Mexico expanded voting rights to citizens on felony probation and parole. In 11 States, a conviction for certain offenses can result in lifetime disenfranchisement. </text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="HECEBBF546E9149FD82E4B88A3505AFC2"><enum>(6)</enum><text>Several States deny the right to vote to individuals convicted of certain misdemeanors.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H9E46B9676FFA4E19879E2B8931EEB406"><enum>(7)</enum><text>In 2022, over 4,600,000 citizens of the United States, or about 1 in 50 adults in the United States, could not vote as a result of a felony conviction. Of the 4,600,000 citizens barred from voting then, only 23 percent were in prison or jail. By contrast, 75 percent of persons disenfranchised then resided in their communities while on probation or parole or after having completed their sentences. Approximately 2,200,000 citizens who had completed their sentences were disenfranchised due to restrictive State laws. Over 930,000 Floridians who completed their sentence remain disenfranchised because of a pay-to-vote requirement that was enacted by Florida lawmakers in 2019 to undermine the impact of a 2018 ballot initiative that eliminated the lifetime ban for persons with certain felony convictions. In 3 States—Alabama, Mississippi, and Tennessee—more than 8 percent of the total population is disenfranchised.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H0348DC5BC741434BAD3C99C3015F84C6"><enum>(8)</enum><text>In those States that disenfranchise individuals post-sentence, the right to vote can be regained in theory, but in practice this possibility is often granted in a non-uniform and potentially discriminatory manner. Disenfranchised individuals sometimes must either obtain a pardon or an order from the Governor or an action by the parole or pardon board, depending on the offense and State. Financial restrictions may also inhibit individuals who have completed their sentences from re-enfranchisement. Individuals convicted of a Federal offense often have additional barriers to regaining voting rights.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H7A758342261F4EB8B551EFD6FBB76DBA"><enum>(9)</enum><text>Many felony disenfranchisement laws today derive directly from post-Civil War efforts to stifle the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. Between 1865 and 1880, at least 14 States—Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New York, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas—enacted or expanded their felony disenfranchisement laws. One of the primary goals of these laws was to prevent African Americans from voting. Of the States that enacted or expanded their felony disenfranchisement laws during this post-Civil War period, at least 11 continue to preclude persons on felony probation or parole from voting. </text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H191237EC5EAD4628BA50D2E4F8060ECC"><enum>(10)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">State disenfranchisement laws disproportionately impact racial and ethnic minorities. In recent years, African Americans have been imprisoned at over 5 times the rate of Whites. More than 6 percent of the voting-age African-American population, or 1,800,000 African Americans, are disenfranchised due to a felony conviction. In 9 States—Alabama (16 percent), Arizona (13 percent), Florida (15 percent), Kentucky (15 percent), Mississippi (16 percent), South Dakota (14 percent), Tennessee (21 percent), Virginia (16 percent), and Wyoming (36 percent)—more than 1 in 8 African Americans are unable to vote because of a felony conviction, twice the national average for African Americans. </text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H9952567002EE4E279BFCA508754E4BC0"><enum>(11)</enum><text>Latino citizens are also disproportionately disenfranchised based upon their disproportionate representation in the criminal justice system. Although data on ethnicity in correctional populations are unevenly reported and undercounted in some States, a conservative estimate is that at least 506,000 Latino Americans or 1.7 percent of the voting-age population are disenfranchised. In 31 States Latinos are disenfranchised at a higher rate than the general population. In Arizona and Tennessee over 6 percent of Latino voters are disenfranchised due to a felony conviction. </text></paragraph> 
<paragraph commented="no" display-inline="no-display-inline" id="H6B9BFDEFDCB84E8B9444B2B1E05505B2"><enum>(12)</enum><text>Women have been significantly impacted by mass incarceration since the early 1980s. Approximately 1,000,000 women were disenfranchised in 2022, comprising over 20 percent of the total disenfranchised population.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H440A0EE1D2B14907AF6B231992CA6A5A"><enum>(13)</enum><text>Disenfranchising citizens who have been convicted of a criminal offense and who are living and working in the community serves no compelling State interest and hinders their rehabilitation and reintegration into society. Models of successful re-entry for persons convicted of a crime emphasize the importance of community ties, feeling vested and integrated, and prosocial attitudes. Individuals with criminal convictions who succeed in avoiding recidivism are typically more likely to see themselves as law-abiding members of the community. Restoration of voting rights builds those qualities and facilitates reintegration into the community. That is why allowing citizens with criminal convictions who are living in a community to vote is correlated with a lower likelihood of recidivism. Restoration of voting rights thus reduces violence and protects public safety. </text></paragraph>

<paragraph id="HD71DCEC601744F5091A9FC59E01CD4B6"><enum>(16)</enum><text>The Eighth Amendment’s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishments <quote>guarantees individuals the right not to be subjected to excessive sanctions</quote>. (Roper v. Simmons, 543 U.S. 551, 560 (2005)). That right stems from the basic precept of justice <quote>that punishment for crime should be graduated and proportioned to [the] offense</quote>. Id. (quoting Weems v. United States, 217 U.S. 349, 367 (1910)). As the Supreme Court has long recognized, <quote>[t]he concept of proportionality is central to the Eighth Amendment</quote>. (Graham v. Florida, 560 U.S. 48, 59 (2010)). Many State disenfranchisement laws are grossly disproportional to the offenses that lead to disenfranchisement and thus violate the bar on cruel and unusual punishments. For example, a number of States mandate lifetime disenfranchisement for a single felony conviction or just two felony convictions, even where the convictions were for non-violent offenses. In numerous other States, disenfranchisement can last years or even decades while individuals remain on probation or parole, often only because a person cannot pay their legal financial obligations. These kinds of extreme voting bans run afoul of the Eighth Amendment.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H64252C960A544729B943684A8EE31138" commented="no" display-inline="no-display-inline"><enum>(17)</enum><text>The Twenty-Fourth Amendment provides that the right to vote <quote>shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or any State by reason of failure to pay any poll tax or other tax</quote>. Section 2 of the Twenty-Fourth Amendment gives Congress the power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation. Court fines and fees that individuals must pay to have their voting rights restored constitute an <quote>other tax</quote> for purposes of the Twenty-Fourth Amendment. At least five States explicitly require the payment of fines and fees before individuals with felony convictions can have their voting rights restored. More than 20 other States effectively tie the right to vote to the payment of fines and fees, by requiring that individuals complete their probation or parole before their rights are restored. In these States, the non-payment of fines and fees is a basis on which probation or parole can be extended. Moreover, these States sometimes do not record the basis on which an individual’s probation or parole was extended, making it impossible to determine from the State’s records whether non-payment of fines and fees is the reason that an individual remains on probation or parole. For these reasons, the only way to ensure that States do not deny the right to vote based solely on non-payment of fines and fees is to prevent States from conditioning voting rights on the completion of probation or parole. </text></paragraph></section>

<paragraph id="H0F13FF04E94042D0937640813ACDB74C"><enum>(1)</enum><text>In 2002, the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (<external-xref legal-doc="public-law" parsable-cite="pl/107/155">Public Law 107–155</external-xref>) became law, establishing disclosure requirements for political advertisements distributed from a television or radio broadcast station or provider of cable or satellite television. In 2003, the Supreme Court upheld regulations on electioneering communications established under the Act, noting that such requirements <quote>provide the electorate with information and insure that the voters are fully informed about the person or group who is speaking</quote>. The Court reaffirmed this conclusion in 2010 by an 8–1 vote.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H4DCC0144507F42A78103F9240E72E5FE"><enum>(2)</enum><text>In its 2006 rulemaking, the Federal Election Commission, the independent Federal agency charged with protecting the integrity of the Federal campaign finance process, noted that 18 percent of all Americans cited the internet as their leading source of news about the 2004 Presidential election. By contrast, Gallup and the Knight Foundation found in 2020 that the majority of Americans, 58 percent, got most of their news about elections online.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="HDAE44C10916745EC82E9F7E46A4D1988"><enum>(3)</enum><text>According to studies from AdImpact and Borrell Associates, in 2020, an estimated $1,700,000,000 was spent on online political advertising, more than 10 times the amount spent in 2012.</text></paragraph> <paragraph commented="no" display-inline="no-display-inline" id="H80A16C1CD27547AA88693CE870D8212A"><enum>(4)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">In order to enhance transparency of all political advertisement funding, it is prudent to extend to online internet platforms the same types of political advertisement disclosure requirements applicable to broadcast television and radio stations, and providers of cable and satellite television.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="HA5F279FD370A4779AD28904C58213613"><enum>(5)</enum><text>Effective and complete transparency for voters must include information about the true and original source of money given, transferred, and spent on political advertisements made online.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H3E002347BDD345A286FF9D34021D3A95"><enum>(6)</enum><text>Requiring the disclosure of this information is a necessary and narrowly tailored means to inform the voting public of who is behind digital advertising disseminated to influence their votes and to enable the Federal Election Commission and the Department of Justice to detect and prosecute illegal foreign spending on local, State, and Federal elections and other campaign finance violations.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="HF349286AE78B424B86C568A66A9D7BD4"><enum>(7)</enum><text>Paid advertising on large online platforms is different from advertising placed on other common media in terms of the comparatively low cost of reaching large numbers of people, the availability of sophisticated microtargeting, and the ease with which online advertisers, particularly those located outside the United States, can evade disclosure requirements. Requiring large online platforms to maintain public files of information about the online political ads they disseminate is the best and least restrictive means to ensure the voting public has complete information about who is trying to influence their votes and to aid enforcement of other laws, including the prohibition on foreign money in domestic campaigns. </text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H8205005B8890487FBAE866037B9579C0"><enum>(8)</enum><text>The reach of a few large internet platforms—larger than any broadcast, satellite, or cable provider—has greatly facilitated the scope and effectiveness of disinformation campaigns. For instance, the largest platform has over 247,000,000 American users—over 153,000,000 of them on a daily basis. By contrast, the largest cable television provider has 16,142,000 subscribers, while the largest satellite television provider has 13,300,000 subscribers. And the most-watched television broadcast in United States history had 118,000,000 viewers.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="HAF6D0BE6674D4922B7DB8A1C88455231"><enum>(9)</enum><text>The public nature of broadcast television, radio, and satellite ensures a level of publicity for any political advertisement. These communications are accessible to the press, fact-checkers, and political opponents. This creates strong disincentives for a candidate to disseminate materially false, inflammatory, or contradictory messages to the public. Social media platforms, in contrast, can target portions of the electorate with direct, ephemeral advertisements often on the basis of private information the platform has on individuals, enabling political advertisements that are contradictory, racially or socially inflammatory, or materially false.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="HE6E0620E2CAE4495BEEA64A388FDAFB3"><enum>(10)</enum><text>Large social media platforms are the only entities in possession of certain key data related to paid online ads, including the exact audience targeted by those ads and their number of impressions. Such information, which cannot be reliably disclosed by the purchasers of ads, is extremely useful for informing the electorate, guarding against corruption, and aiding in the enforcement of existing campaign finance regulations.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H8501BC0F46A94B08A867A91253D0A83F"><enum>(11)</enum><text>Paid advertisements on social media platforms have served as critical tools for foreign online influence campaigns—even those that rely on large amounts of unpaid content—because such ads allow foreign actors to test the effectiveness of different messages, expose their messages to audiences who have not sought out such content, and recruit audiences for future campaigns and posts.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H991631E2545A48988A4E548087F8104B"><enum>(12)</enum><text>In a 2019 Senate Select Committee on Intelligence report on Russian Active Measures Campaigns and Interference in the 2016 U.S. Election, Volume II: Russia’s Use of Social Media with Additional Views, the Committee recommended <quote>that Congress examine legislative approaches to ensuring Americans know the sources of online political advertisements. The Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 requires political advertisements on television, radio and satellite to disclose the sponsor of the advertisement. The same requirements should apply online. This will also help to ensure that the IRA or any similarly situated actors cannot use paid advertisements for purposes of foreign interference.</quote>.</text></paragraph>

While the law seems neutral, its actual effect is to privilege the independently wealthy who want to run, because given the demands of running for office, candidates who must work to pay for childcare or to afford health insurance are effectively being left out of the process, even if they have sufficient support to mount a viable campaign.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="HAFDAD74F44C04EEC97FFB21D3A3D8BAF"><enum>(3)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Thus current practice favors those prospective candidates who do not need to rely on a regular paycheck to make ends meet. The consequence is that everyday Americans who have firsthand knowledge of the importance of stable childcare, a safety net, or great public schools are less likely to get a seat at the table. This governance by the few is antithetical to the democratic experiment, but most importantly, when lawmakers do not share the concerns of everyday Americans, their policies reflect that.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H71250504A9C641018632926B9C894139"><enum>(4)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">These circumstances have contributed to a Congress that does not always reflect everyday Americans. The New York Times reported in 2019 that fewer than 5 percent of representatives cite blue-collar or service jobs in their biographies. A 2020 analysis by OpenSecrets of lawmakers’ personal financial disclosure statements showed that the median net worth of lawmakers was just over $1,000,000, or nearly 9 times the median net worth of American families.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H757F4112F95A4CFEA7C1D5329BACB92C"><enum>(5)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">These circumstances have also contributed to a governing body that does not reflect the nation it serves. For instance, women are 51 percent of the American population. Yet even with a record number of women serving in the One Hundred Eighteenth Congress, the Pew Research Center notes that nearly three out of four Members of this Congress are male. The Center for American Women and Politics found that one third of women legislators surveyed had been actively discouraged from running for office, often by political professionals. This type of discouragement, combined with the prohibitions on using campaign funds for domestic needs like childcare, burdens that still fall disproportionately on American women, particularly disadvantages working mothers. These barriers may explain why only 10 women in history have given birth while serving in Congress, in spite of the prevalence of working parents in other professions. Yet working mothers and fathers are best positioned to create policy that reflects the lived experience of most Americans.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H916FE8BA6DA4478DAB03975D246AA1AC"><enum>(6)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Working mothers, those caring for their elderly parents, and young professionals who rely on their jobs for health insurance should have the freedom to run to serve the people of the United States. Their networks and net worth are simply not the best indicators of their strength as prospective public servants. In fact, helping ordinary Americans to run may create better policy for all Americans.</text></paragraph></subsection> 
<subsection id="HA351A15BD90B49D5950BAF987C51A602"><enum>(c)</enum><header>Purpose</header><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">It is the purpose of this subtitle to ensure that all Americans who are otherwise qualified to serve this Nation are able to run for office, regardless of their economic status. By expanding permissible uses of campaign funds and providing modest assurance that testing a run for office will not cost one’s livelihood, the Help America Run Act will facilitate the candidacy of representatives who more accurately reflect the experiences, challenges, and ideals of everyday Americans.</text></subsection></section> <section section-type="subsequent-section" id="H8EB71A4CD38C49A8AA8719F2717F872D"><enum>8202.</enum><header>Treatment of payments for childcare and other personal use services as authorized campaign expenditure</header> <subsection id="HCCD24AAA05C9400185154FAACBBEFB1B"><enum>(a)</enum><header>Personal use services as authorized campaign expenditure</header><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Section 313 of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (<external-xref legal-doc="usc" parsable-cite="usc/52/30114">52 U.S.C. 30114</external-xref>), as amended by section 8113, is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:</text>
