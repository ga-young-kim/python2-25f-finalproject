According to an April 2020 Bureau of Labor Statistics report, the health care and social service industries experienced the highest rates of injuries caused by workplace violence and were 5 times as likely to suffer a workplace violence injury than workers overall in 2018. That report also found that the incidence rate for workplace violence against health care workers had steadily increased since 2011. The COVID–19 pandemic exacerbated this growing problem.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H7391E2349322441788F4B7D6531A653C"><enum>(3)</enum><text>Workplace violence in hospitals inhibits hospital employees from performing their duties and thereby disrupts the delivery of health care services and leads to adverse patient outcomes. Violence towards hospital workers also has been associated with decreased productivity and quality of care, employee absenteeism, and increased employee turnover.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HA87A93B901514CEFBD148124DE1BE2F2"><enum>(4)</enum><text>State and local authorities are now and will continue to be responsible for prosecuting the overwhelming majority of violent crimes in the United States, including assault and intimidation against hospital employees. These authorities can address the problem of assault and intimidation against hospital employees more effectively with greater Federal law enforcement involvement.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HB1EF8D41011247DE9A5F2D60076861A6"><enum>(5)</enum><text>Existing Federal law is inadequate to address this problem.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H29C4A02BA8F34F8C8D317D55D73D8306"><enum>(6)</enum><text>Assault and intimidation against hospital employees substantially affects interstate commerce in many ways, including the following:</text><subparagraph id="HCFC1F6D8AC6243BAAF3AD7E316E69667"><enum>(A)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Health care services are a significant part of the national economy. In 2021, expenditures on health care services accounted for 18.3 percent of the country’s gross domestic product (or $4,300,000,000,000). Within health care, hospitals and health systems are economic pillars that create jobs and support economic growth across State lines. In 2021, hospitals directly employed 6,350,000 individuals. More broadly, hospitals supported 17,815,000 jobs throughout the entire interstate economy—1 out of 8 jobs in the United States—and supported nearly $4,000,000,000 in overall economic activity.</text></subparagraph><subparagraph id="H5914772F23EA45DEBB563A8E55E8FDD7"><enum>(B)</enum><text>The health care market, and hospitals in particular, are heavily regulated by the Federal Government.</text></subparagraph><subparagraph id="HF8A526994A5145FDA41EA3F644B95421"><enum>(C)</enum><text>Hospital revenue comes from interstate or Federal sources, such as out-of-State insurers or Medicare.</text></subparagraph><subparagraph id="HE97EF72AE9E34A6EA4686E19FD8C2D2A"><enum>(D)</enum><text>Hospital employees who are victims of assault or intimidation are prevented from purchasing goods and services, obtaining or sustaining employment, or participating in other commercial activity.</text></subparagraph><subparagraph id="HB09694A797214A3384E1A524A9340622"><enum>(E)</enum><text>Facilities and instrumentalities of interstate commerce have been used in the commission of assault and intimidation against hospital employees.</text></subparagraph><subparagraph id="H32844F5A19C64A43964F80643670A596"><enum>(F)</enum><text>Assault and intimidation against hospital employees has been committed using articles that have traveled in interstate commerce.</text></subparagraph></paragraph><paragraph id="H06A008DB7E094CC29280AF39F42A263E"><enum>(7)</enum><text>In Summit Health, Ltd. v. Pinhas, 500 U.S. 322, 329–30 (1991), the Supreme Court of the United States held that it is <quote>clear</quote> that hospitals are <quote>regularly</quote> engaged in interstate commerce, performing services for out-of-State patients and generating revenues from out-of-State sources.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HF9E0100DEAED424483F38A634794CAF2"><enum>(8)</enum><text>In Taylor v. United States, 579 U.S.___(2016), the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that activities that affect commerce may be regulated so long as they substantially affect interstate commerce in the aggregate, even if their individual impact on interstate commerce is minimal. In addition, as the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit recognized in United States v. Hill, 927 F.3d 188 (4th Cir. 2019), Taylor and other Supreme Court decisions establish that when Congress may regulate an economic or commercial activity—as it may with respect to hospitals—it also may regulate violent conduct that interferes with or affects that activity. Accordingly, if individuals are engaged in ongoing economic or commercial activity subject to congressional regulation—as hospital employees are—then Congress also may prohibit violent crime that interferes with or affects such individuals’ ongoing economic or commercial activity.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H7BA2E7F815784F0AA47E394D47F4212E"><enum>(9)</enum><text>Federal jurisdiction over certain violent crimes against hospital employees enables Federal, State, and local authorities to work together as partners in the investigation and prosecution of such crimes.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HFBBBC386F2734A56BB809714973BF685"><enum>(10)</enum><text>The problem of assault and intimidation against hospital employees is serious, widespread, and interstate in nature as to warrant Federal assistance to hospitals to combat that activity.</text></paragraph></subsection><subsection id="H33CE46DD17C14DB6857738B16E2FB0BF"><enum>(b)</enum><header>Prohibition on interference with hospital personnel in the performance of duties</header><paragraph id="HA74B620D16CD4DEA8AB202FBA94A333B"><enum>(1)</enum><header>In general</header><text><external-xref legal-doc="usc-chapter" parsable-cite="usc-chapter/18/7">Chapter 7</external-xref> of title 18, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:</text><quoted-block id="H442BE5857B5A4B49B49E4EC3ABA3B7E1" style="USC"><section id="HDC9E577E95844B069C01EAC337127FB3"><enum>120.</enum><header>Interference with performance of duties of hospital personnel</header><subsection id="HEDAC3066A0D94E0D9954FE65953DB52D"><enum>(a)</enum><header>In general</header><text>Whoever knowingly assaults or intimidates an individual employed by a hospital, or an entity contracting with a hospital or other medical facility, during the course of the performance of the duties of such individual, and, as a result, interferes with the performance of the duties of such individual or limits the ability of such individual to perform such duties, shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both. </text></subsection><subsection id="H87F393BBD2DB428385B91509F3BE46EA"><enum>(b)</enum><header>Enhanced penalties</header><paragraph id="HC5E47D0AB0CA453984F93CE0EA1BD89B"><enum>(1)</enum><header>Acts involving dangerous weapons or acts that result in bodily injury</header><text>Whoever, in the commission of any act described in subsection (a), uses a deadly or dangerous weapon or inflicts bodily injury, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H93A8AFF58326421B8F9A53C771F2E343"><enum>(2)</enum><header>Acts committed during emergency declarations</header><text>Whoever commits any act described in subsection (a) during the period of a declaration of a public emergency for the area in which the act is committed shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both.</text></paragraph></subsection><subsection id="HCD550C01E1CF4E91B074162F3354FC06"><enum>(c)</enum><header>Defense</header><text>It shall be a defense to a prosecution under this section that—</text><paragraph id="H2653360E84354E08885D424957374E30"><enum>(1)</enum><text>the defendant is a person with a physical, mental, or intellectual disability;
