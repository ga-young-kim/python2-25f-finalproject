<paragraph id="H9A0F1E7ED57040319DE4D90C847B5E92"><enum>(1)</enum><text>Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription pharmaceuticals is legally permitted in only 2 developed countries, the United States and New Zealand.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="HCC29906CB4004043897CF61F83BF0E5E"><enum>(2)</enum><text>In 2018, pharmaceutical ad spending exceeded $6,046,000,000, a 4.8-percent increase over 2017, resulting in the average American seeing 9 drug advertisements per day.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="HCCF53301FE434C69AFB2DF0744E8AF5A"><enum>(3)</enum><text>The most commonly advertised medication in the United States in 2020 had a list price of more than $6,000 for a one-month’s supply.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H6C5B7BB549F940FFBD6AF95B6E641D7D"><enum>(4)</enum><text>A 2021 Government Accountability Office report found that two-thirds of all direct-to-consumer drug advertising between 2016 and 2018 was concentrated among 39 brand-name drugs or biologicals, about half of which were recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H219067E836434CC9B382F80811448B9B"><enum>(5)</enum><text>According to a 2011 Congressional Budget Office report, pharmaceutical manufacturers advertise their products directly to consumers in an attempt to boost demand for their products and thereby raise the price that consumers are willing to pay, increase the quantity of drugs sold, or achieve some combination of the two.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H1280CFD676654DF4AC9AB5A6EDFE48FC"><enum>(6)</enum><text>Studies, including a 2012 systematic review published in the Annual Review of Public Health, a 2005 randomized trial published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, and a 2004 survey published in Health Affairs, show that patients are more likely to ask their doctor for a specific medication and for the doctor to write a prescription for it, if a patient has seen an advertisement for such medication, even if such medication is not the most clinically appropriate for the patient or if a lower cost generic medication may be available.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="HACEFC8A3316E461888F1EE0A480944CF"><enum>(7)</enum><text>According to a 2011 Congressional Budget Office report, the average number of prescriptions written for newly approved brand-name drugs with direct-to-consumer advertising was 9 times greater than the average number of prescriptions written for newly approved brand-name drugs without direct-to-consumer advertising.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H5E3889BB97CB4165B49FC4526C1AFD57"><enum>(8)</enum><text>The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services is the single largest drug payer in the United States. Between 2016 and 2018, 58 percent of the $560,000,000,000 in Medicare drug spending was for advertised drugs, and in 2018 alone, the 20 most advertised drugs on television cost Medicare and Medicaid a combined $34,000,000,000.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H6D8B73665EFF42118516D9C54AA25801"><enum>(9)</enum><text>A 2021 Government Accountability Office report found that direct-to-consumer advertising may have contributed to increases in Medicare beneficiary use and spending among certain drugs.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H210C8ABA0A8F45D991247564C9FA55D3"><enum>(10)</enum><text>The American Medical Association has passed resolutions supporting the requirement for price transparency in any direct-to-consumer advertising, stating that such advertisements on their own <quote>inflate demand for new and more expensive drugs, even when these drugs may not be appropriate</quote>.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="HD7B69B25C04B42D79BE5556E5AD4E333"><enum>(11)</enum><text>A 2019 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that health care consumers dramatically underestimate their out-of-pocket costs for certain expensive medications, but once they learn the wholesale acquisition cost (in this section referred to as the <quote>WAC</quote>) of the product, they are far better able to approximate their out-of-pocket costs.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="HC582A96512A14173A4BE12075839EAED"><enum>(12)</enum><text>Approximately half of Americans have high-deductible health plans, under which they often pay the list price of a drug until their insurance deductible is met. All of the top Medicare prescription drug plans use coinsurance rather than fixed-dollar copayments for medications on nonpreferred drug tiers, exposing beneficiaries to WAC prices.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H0A0FC14A1FEF43A4A29BF4E8894880F8"><enum>(13)</enum><text>Section 119 of division CC of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (<external-xref legal-doc="public-law" parsable-cite="pl/116/260">Public Law 116–260</external-xref>) requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to increase the use of real-time benefit tools to lower beneficiary costs. However, there still remains a lack of available pricing tools so patients may not learn of their medication’s cost until after being given a prescription for the medication. A 2013 study published in The Oncologist found that one-quarter of all cancer patients chose not to fill a prescription due to cost.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H8C26145B1473494BB944EE4034EB1408"><enum>(14)</enum><text>The Federal Government already exercises its authority to oversee certain aspects of direct-to-consumer drug advertising, including required disclosures of information related to side effects, contraindications, and effectiveness.</text></paragraph></subsection>
