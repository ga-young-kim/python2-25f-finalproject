<paragraph id="HE17B0B2EB8724DA082B6481455A3BDAC"><enum>(1)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">In 1991, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service required the use of nontoxic ammunition for all waterfowl hunting.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H42DB6C583E0B45B5ABED42CDA148E0A7"><enum>(2)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Research has shown that the presence of lead in the environment poses a threat to human and wildlife health.</text></paragraph>
<paragraph id="H2570F70D34604230932F8D5CC60F412B"><enum>(3)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">The Environmental Protection Agency has determined that lead is toxic to both humans and animals, and can negatively affect nearly every organ and system in the human body, including the heart, bones, intestines, kidneys, and reproductive and nervous systems. Lead exposure interferes with the development of the nervous system and is therefore particularly toxic to children, causing potentially permanent learning and behavioral disorders.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="HDB51D90BC3644A7EB31CE5CFAD7A40B4"><enum>(4)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Lead is a potent neurotoxin, for which no safe exposure level exists for humans. The use of lead has been outlawed in and removed from paint, gasoline, children’s toys, and many other items to protect human health and wildlife.</text></paragraph>
<paragraph id="HAC1D765DABF54E3E83A3B8E79B3497DF"><enum>(5)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Wildlife, including federally listed threatened and endangered species, is at risk of lead toxicosis through the ingestion of lead ammunition, either directly by ingesting lead from spent ballistic materials while foraging, or indirectly by scavenging carcasses and viscera left by hunters. Lead may also pollute soil and water around outdoor shooting ranges.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="HA30A10D36A514AAA9B5E8A2FAEE142A5"><enum>(6)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Lead ammunition also endangers human food supplies. Dairy and beef cattle have developed lead poisoning after feeding in areas where spent lead ammunition has accumulated. Spent lead ammunition can also contaminate crops, vegetation, and waterways.</text></paragraph>
