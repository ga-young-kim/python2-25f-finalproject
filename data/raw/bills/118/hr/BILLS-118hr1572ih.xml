As a historically neutral nation, the United States was unprepared to fight a technologically modern conflict overseas. The United States called upon American Telephone and Telegraph (referred to in this section as <quote>AT&amp;T</quote>) to provide equipment and trained personnel for the Army Signal Corps in France. AT&amp;T executives in Army uniform served at home under the provisions of the Act entitled <quote>An Act for making further and more effectual provision for the national defense, and for other purposes.</quote>, approved June 3, 1916 (referred to in this section as the <quote>National Defense Act of 1916</quote>), which allowed for the induction of individuals with specialized skills into a reserve force.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H11C47FDDCFEF4D398D89C3754C64DF4B"><enum>(2)</enum><text>When General John Pershing sailed for Europe in May of 1917, as head of the American Expeditionary Forces (referred to in this section as the <quote>AEF</quote>), he took telephone operating equipment with him in recognition of the inadequacy of European circuitry and with the understanding that telephones would play a key role in battlefield communications for the first time in the history of war.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H386FBC74BF6840D4BB366E472CD4DC8B"><enum>(3)</enum><text>From May to November of 1917, the AEF struggled to develop the telephone service necessary for the Army to function under battlefield conditions. Monolingual infantrymen from the United States were unable to connect calls rapidly or communicate effectively with their French counterparts to put calls through over toll lines that linked one region of the country with another. The Army found that the average male operator required 60 seconds to make a connection. That rate was unacceptably slow, especially for operational calls between command outposts and the front lines.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H525D3A388EA047CCAAC3E96233BAE1E9"><enum>(4)</enum><text>During this time, in the United States, telephone operating was largely sex-segregated. Hired for their speed in connecting calls, women filled 85 percent of the telephone operating positions in the United States. It took the average female operator 10 seconds to make a connection.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H058B25BB22214B6CA2F46B2435E63D77"><enum>(5)</enum><text>On November 8, 1917, General Pershing cabled the War Department and wrote, <quote>On account of the great difficulty of obtaining properly qualified men, request organization and dispatch to France a force of women telephone operators all speaking French and English equally well.</quote>. To begin, General Pershing requested 100 women under the command of a commissioned captain, writing that <quote>All should have allowances of Army nurses and should be uniformed.</quote>.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HEB10CFAA036B4287AEB1014313778AAA"><enum>(6)</enum><text>The War Department sent press releases to newspapers across the United States to recruit women willing to serve for the duration of the war and face the hazards of submarine warfare and aerial bombardment. These articles emphasized that patriotic women would be <quote>full-fledged soldier[s] under the articles of war</quote> and would <quote>do as much to help win the war as the men in khaki who go <quote>over the top.</quote></quote>. All women selected would take the Army oath.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H6DD848260B3148EBB1F0E236101AD3CA"><enum>(7)</enum><text>More than 7,600 women volunteered for the 100 positions described in paragraph (5) and the first recruits took the Army oath on January 15, 1918.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H23EBBC00D1B6454982A119760EF61834"><enum>(8)</enum><text>Like nurses and doctors at the time, female Signal Corps members had relative rather than traditional ranks and were ranked as Operator, Supervisor, or Chief Operator. When promoted, the women were required to swear the Army oath again.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HF5F9C86EC1474D8E92FB79AEB2EB7960"><enum>(9)</enum><text>Telephone operators were the first women to serve as soldiers in non-medical classifications and the job of the operators was to help win the war, not to mitigate the harms of the war. In popular parlance, they were known as the <quote>Hello Girls</quote>.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H8CF74246EEA949719D13C7AAA685413B"><enum>(10)</enum><text>Signal Corps Operators wore Army uniforms and Army insignia always, as well as standard-issue identity disks in case of death, and were subject to court martial for infractions of the military code.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H829AF6DFE51A47A09AD2B32410B4DB9D"><enum>(11)</enum><text>Unbeknownst to the women operators and their immediate officers, the legal counsel of the Army ruled internally on March 20, 1918, that the women were not actually soldiers but contract employees, even though the women had not seen or signed any contracts. Military code allowed only for the induction of men and the code remained unchanged despite the orders of General Pershing. Nevertheless, legal counsel also recognized that the National Defense Act of 1916, which allowed for the induction of members of the telephone industry of the United States into the Armed Forces, imposed no gender restrictions.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HF65A1901E73F4CD1A716BBEAF31EF978"><enum>(12)</enum><text>Four days later, on March 24, 1918, the first contingent of operators began their official duties in France. The operators arrived before most infantrymen of the Armed Forces in order to facilitate logistics and deployment and spent their first night in Paris under German bombardment.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HDE3F866C0D1B42A09F3680B1D03D38D9"><enum>(13)</enum><text>After the arrival of the operators, telephone service in France improved immediately, as calls tripled from 13,000 to 36,000 per day.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H3B699D00B02E44619957EA88E0023021"><enum>(14)</enum><text>The Army quickly recruited, trained, and deployed 5 additional contingents of female Signal Corps operators. With these personnel, calls increased to 150,000 per day.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HFA070F36DEA04F63A7221853C4CF89E2"><enum>(15)</enum><text>In addition to standard telephone operating, bilingual Signal Corps members provided simultaneous translation between officers from France and officers from the United States, who were communicating by telephone.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H1977C173EA9F421AB96B77476DEA8458"><enum>(16)</enum><text>The AEF fought their first major battles in the last 2 months of the war. By that point, the Signal Corps considered the contributions of women to be so essential that, in telephone exchanges closest to the front line, the Army exclusively used women, in rotating 12-hour shifts. In the rear, the Army established rotating 8-hour shifts and gave male soldiers the overnight shift when telephone traffic was slower.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H977CC49A6E214C33A1E2BC1B7B184EC9"><enum>(17)</enum><text>Seven bilingual operatorsâ€”</text><subparagraph id="H2C7C703A8525428990C761602547BCDC"><enum>(A)</enum><text>served at the Battles of St. Mihiel and Meuse-Argonne under the immediate command of General Pershing;</text></subparagraph><subparagraph id="H9740AC1DE4AA40C2A6C1D85933879666"><enum>(B)</enum><text>staffed the Operations Boards through which orders to advance, fire, and retreat were delivered to soldiers in the trenches, to artillery units on alert, and to pilots awaiting orders at French airfields; and</text></subparagraph><subparagraph id="H39B426EA80E448CC99A6BE7C11B10E61"><enum>(C)</enum><text>were awarded a <quote>Defensive Sector Clasp</quote> for the Meuse-Argonne operation.</text></subparagraph></paragraph><paragraph id="HB32CB9B87C5544559DE65F8DE0813534"><enum>(18)</enum><text>The Chief Operator supervising the Hello Girls, Grace Banker of Passaic, New Jersey, was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal.
