The blast—linked to 2,750 metric tons of ammonium nitrate stored in a warehouse—killed at least 220 people, wounded approximately 7,000, left an estimated 300,000 people homeless, and caused approximately $15,000,000,000 in property damage.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H05CB481A471B4413BC44989BAC520C7F"><enum>(2)</enum><text>The COVID–19 pandemic has taken a heavy toll on Lebanon, which has recorded over 1,235,000 cases and 10,800 deaths since the pandemic began. Lebanon’s public health system, already weakened by the Beirut disaster and political upheaval, has struggled to cope in the face of the pandemic.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H795AD5A53D69477D83594A3684108150"><enum>(3)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Lebanon lacked a fully formed government for much of the COVID–19 pandemic and the political establishment remains highly polarized and divided. The political crisis has become so severe that on April 18, 2023 Lebanon’s parliament voted to extend the terms of municipal councils and other local officials to avoid further paralysis. The current government is acting in a caretaker capacity and the presidency has been empty since President Aoun’s term expired in October 2022.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H9E3E7882E08243CB97A6AE98157DE37E"><enum>(4)</enum><text>Lebanon has been experiencing one of the worst economic crises in its history at the same time as the COVID–19 pandemic, Beirut Port explosion, and political crisis.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HE119716091B74A59A637A199A8820F5B"><enum>(5)</enum><text>According to the United Nations, over 3,500,000 Lebanese people are estimated to live in poverty and around three-quarters are now income vulnerable. Before the value of the Lebanese pound started spiraling in late 2019, the country’s monthly minimum wage was 675,000 pounds—about $450—but today it is worth less than $7.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H80AB42DA079B4F1C906ECAC0D7239A7A"><enum>(6)</enum><text>Per the United Nations, 36 percent of the Lebanese population (1,380,000 people) is experiencing extreme poverty.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H060472833D534CE2B506C6DDB9BEFB39"><enum>(7)</enum><text>Since October 2019, the Lebanese pound has lost more than 95 percent of its value, placing Lebanon amongst the top 5 economic crises globally according to the World Bank.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HDBC5D602A5AA44BB9F2999C413722AA5"><enum>(8)</enum><text>Food prices have skyrocketed throughout the crisis, increasing 400 percent in 2020 alone.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HF4EB0FE0020847FB8D1353F33393DFBC"><enum>(9)</enum><text>In July 2021, the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) warned that Lebanon’s water system is on the verge of collapse, with more than 70 percent of the country facing critical water shortages. In January 2019, 1,000 Lebanese pounds bought 4 liters of water. By August 2021, it only bought half a liter.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H047B4764FC2B40D38B79D87EBA5B09CA"><enum>(10)</enum><text>In October 2022, Lebanon reported its first cholera cases in 30 years, with 5,819 suspected and confirmed cases and 23 deaths reported by December 31, 2022.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HF0417A5D1114401BA7B3EEA3D69B72BA"><enum>(11)</enum><text>Dire fuel shortages plague Lebanon, leading the American University of Beirut Medical Center, Beirut’s top hospital and one of the leading medical centers in the region, to issue a warning in August 2021 that hundreds of patients would die if they failed to secure enough fuel to keep their generators running.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HBAFF8E3DA4154CD8B6C38DE66F74AB2A"><enum>(12)</enum><text>The United Nations has reported that, as of December 2022, the mass exodus of public health workers from Lebanon has continued with devastating effect, with approximately 40 percent of doctors, 15 percent of specialized neonatal intensive care unit nurses, and 30 percent of midwives leaving the country over the course of the crisis. This has resulted in critical gaps in the quality, availability, and accessibility of health care for the population.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HBEF97E0741C345F8867DF604F7630896"><enum>(13)</enum><text>The combined crises have strained many of Lebanon’s public institutions to the breaking point, including the Lebanese Army, whose budget and soldiers’ salaries have been devastated by the devaluation of the Lebanese pound.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HCBA7A531422947E4B387677D217B0E23"><enum>(14)</enum><text>On October 14, 2021, gunmen fired on a crowd of protestors gathered near the Beirut Justice Palace sparking heavy armed clashes in nearby neighborhoods.

Any returned individual would have to contend without access to clean water, adequate health care, and affordable basic necessities—all in the face of the very real threat of significant political violence and armed conflict.
