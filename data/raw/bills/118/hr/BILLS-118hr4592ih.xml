While the effects of a single pollutant from a single source may be less significant when analyzed in isolation, the cumulative impacts of multiple pollutants from multiple sources in combination with each other and with other social vulnerabilities degrade public health and the environment substantially. Cumulative impact assessments should be incorporated into pollution permitting decisions such that Federal regulators are required to deny permits that threaten public health and the environment.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H76BA5815A76E4B3886CE887034633645"><enum>(12)</enum><text>The general failure of the Federal Government to consider and regulate potential cumulative impacts in pollution permitting decisions has resulted in the inequitable distribution of pollution across regions and overburdening of certain communities.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H2E6144C598644671BC2913887D6322F4"><enum>(13)</enum><text>Federal Government inaction has forced some State and local governments to act on their own to regulate cumulative impacts, including California and New Jersey, creating a patchwork of cumulative impact regulations across the country.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H752033E5BD934E64A184243128BD1137"><enum>(14)</enum><text>The Federal Government is aware of the importance of cumulative impact assessment in other types of environmental review, such as with environmental assessments conducted under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (<external-xref legal-doc="usc" parsable-cite="usc/42/4321">42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.</external-xref>).</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H719E05CA67124582BFC7AA28A0770055"><enum>(15)</enum><text>The Federal Government should adopt and operationalize cumulative impact assessment in all pollution permitting decisions, especially in overburdened communities, and should deny permits that create a reasonable certainty of harm to communities.</text></paragraph></section><section id="H484BBD5D1A784EA49F4C9E92468E602F"><enum>3.</enum><header>Consideration of cumulative impacts and persistent violations in certain permitting decisions</header><subsection id="HB1917A21DAFC4894B28066B021AF23C6"><enum>(a)</enum><header>Federal Water Pollution Control Act</header><text>Section 402 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (<external-xref legal-doc="usc" parsable-cite="usc/33/1342">33 U.S.C. 1342</external-xref>) is amended—</text><paragraph id="HE20C02D8444947CCA75AEC88506F1FDB"><enum>(1)</enum><text>by striking the section designation and heading and all that follows through <quote>Except as</quote> in subsection (a)(1) and inserting the following:</text><quoted-block id="HA3755561DC5D4CF1AC957B0B41115AE3" style="OLC"><section id="HFCA5C04D3F5A4545A0F51C8DE2FECC18"><enum>402.</enum><header>National pollutant discharge elimination system</header><subsection id="HEB518B1151C34D46ADE2F0899EF3DAF0"><enum>(a)</enum><header>Permits issued by administrator</header><paragraph id="H970187AB3BBD4403BABD329D122F62BC"><enum>(1)</enum><header>In general</header><text>Except as</text></paragraph></subsection></section><after-quoted-block>;</after-quoted-block></quoted-block></paragraph><paragraph id="HD99404260C184DDFAC2D996A717CAF14"><enum>(2)</enum><text>in subsection (a)—</text><subparagraph id="H5D67305100324FE2A99041C7260EBF0D"><enum>(A)</enum><text>in paragraph (1)—</text><clause id="HA993EF6D05724921A2063E73DEDD581C"><enum>(i)</enum><text>by striking <quote>upon condition that such discharge will meet either (A) all</quote> and inserting the following: </text><quoted-block id="H01DA1658A3174233A8E004FDFB9D2042" style="OLC" display-inline="yes-display-inline"><text>subject to the conditions that—</text><subparagraph id="H27F1EDE6F1DA4C7DB02472C5E10D31ED"><enum>(A)</enum><text>the discharge will achieve compliance with, as applicable—</text><clause id="HA23BE607F5EE4DA685FF5A4B5A76F105"><enum>(i)</enum><text>all</text></clause></subparagraph><after-quoted-block>;</after-quoted-block></quoted-block></clause><clause id="H3AE097917FB844699259BBB6EC90ABDD"><enum>(ii)</enum><text>by striking <quote>403 of this Act, or (B) prior</quote> and inserting the following: </text><quoted-block style="OLC" id="H9112A6285EA04DE4A4ED136957A4E506" display-inline="yes-display-inline"><text>403;
