If any personnel in such a position are currently above the GS-10 level, they must be reassigned to another position within 180 days of this bill's passage. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;TITLE IV--MILITARY PERSONNEL AUTHORIZATIONS&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This title authorizes appropriations for military personnel and sets active component and reserve component end-strength levels. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Below&amp;nbsp;are some examples of provisions in this title.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sec. 401 authorizes the maximum number of active-duty personnel as of September 30, 2024 for each of the armed forces as follows: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Army - 452,000, &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Navy - 347,000, &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Marine Corps - 172,300, &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Air Force - 324,700, and&amp;nbsp; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Space Force - 9,400.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sec. 411 authorizes the maximum number of Selected Reserve personnel as of September 30, 2024 for each of the reserve components: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Army National Guard - 325,000, &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Army Reserve - 174,800, &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Navy Reserve - 57,200, &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Marine Corps Reserve - 33,600, &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Air National Guard - 108,400, &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Air Force Reserve - 69,600, and&amp;nbsp; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Coast Guard Reserve - 7,000.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;TITLE V--MILITARY PERSONNEL POLICY&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This title sets policy regarding officer personnel, reserve component management, military records, military justice and other legal matters, servicemember education and training, transition programs, awards and decorations, and other personnel matters.&lt;strike&gt;&lt;/strike&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Below&amp;nbsp;are some examples of provisions in this title.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sec. 502 increases the maximum number of general officers on active duty authorized for the Space Force from 21 to 25, and increases the minimum number of Space Force general officers assigned to designated joint duty positions from 6 to 10 (these positions are excluded from the cap mentioned in the first part of the sentence). This section also reduces a temporary authority for additional joint duty general and flag officers designated for overseas contingency operations. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sec. 511 specifies that (1) the Chief of Army Reserve, Commander of Marine Forces Reserve, and Chief of Air Force Reserve shall all hold the grade of Lieutenant General while serving in those positions; and (2) the Chief of Navy Reserve shall hold the grade of Vice Admiral while serving in that position. (These positions currently carry those grades, but they are set by executive branch determination rather than statute.) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sec. 514 specifies that the Vice Chief of the National Guard Bureau shall hold the grade of General. (This position currently carries the grade of Lieutenant General, as set by executive branch determination.) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sec. 523 requires DOD to issue regulations specifying that recruiting efforts for the armed forces (excluding the Coast Guard) may not consider the race or gender of the individuals being recruited. DOD must also issue regulations to ensure that all accessions, assignments, selections, or promotions are made based on merit and individuals are evaluated on the basis of qualifications, performance, integrity, fitness, training, and conduct. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sec. 525 prohibits the Departments of the Army, Navy, Air Force and Homeland Security (with respect to the Coast Guard) from taking adverse action against any member of the armed forces solely based on the member refusing to receive a COVID-19 vaccination. It also requires the military departments to consider reinstating those who were involuntarily separated solely based on refusing to receive a COVID-19 vaccination. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sec. 574 section expands eligibility for the Troops-to-Teachers program to include qualified members of the armed forces who are seeking to become administrators or instructors in the Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps. This section also extends the Troop-to-Teachers program through July 1, 2027. (The program helps service members and veterans become teachers in K-12 schools.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;TITLE VI--COMPENSATION AND OTHER PERSONNEL BENEFITS&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This title sets policy regarding various aspects of military compensation, including allowances, bonus and incentive pays, child care benefits, and education for military dependents.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Below&amp;nbsp;are some examples of provisions in this title.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sec. 601 provides paid parental leave for certain members of the reserve component not serving on active duty. The leave must generally occur within one year of the birth or adoption of a child of the member, or the placement of a minor child with the member for adoption or long-term foster care. Eligible members shall receive leave for up to 12 periods of inactive duty training, and receive pay and retirement credit for those periods. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sec. 611 extends by one year (through December 31, 2024) a variety of compensation authorities for the uniformed services, including bonuses for enlisted and officer personnel, hazardous duty pay, special duty pay, and skill incentive pay. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sec. 613 specifies that for the purposes of assignment pay&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;or&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;special duty pay, the military departments shall designate a duty station as a cold weather location if it meets certain criteria (e.g., if a member of the uniformed services receives mountaineering training at the station). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sec. 621 excludes all amounts received as a&amp;nbsp;Basic Allowance for Housing&amp;nbsp;from the calculation of gross household income used to determine eligibility for the Basic Needs Allowance. (The&amp;nbsp;Basic Needs Allowance&amp;nbsp;is provided to servicemembers with dependents and typically having a gross household income less than or equal to 150% of the federal poverty guidelines. Currently, amounts received as a Basic Allowance for Housing are typically included&amp;nbsp;when calculating&amp;nbsp;a servicemember's gross household income.) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sec. 628 increases the Family Separation Allowance from $250 to $400 per month. The President must review this allowance every four years, during the quadrennial review of military compensation, and recommend whether to increase the allowance further. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sec. 651 provides certain rights to parents of children attending schools operated by the Department of Defense Educational Activity (DODEA). Specified rights include the right to (1) review the curriculum, (2) meet with teachers of their children at least twice a year, and (3) review all instructional materials. This section also requires DODEA schools to publicly post certain information and notify parents of certain plans and events, such as any plans to eliminate gifted and talented programs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For additional information see&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IN/IN12196"&gt;CRS Insight IN12196, FY2024 NDAA: &lt;em&gt;Basic Needs Allowance and Military Food Insecurity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;TITLE VII--HEALTH CARE PROVISIONS&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This title sets policy regarding military health care, including TRICARE, the medical and dental care program for members and former members of the uniformed services and their dependents.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Below&amp;nbsp;are some examples of provisions in this title.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sec. 701 allows DOD to establish a premium-free dental plan for members of the Selected Reserve. Participants in this plan may not be charged copays for services covered by the plan. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sec. 707 prohibits for one year the imposition of cost-sharing on prescription contraceptives or other contraceptive methods for specified beneficiaries of DOD's TRICARE health benefits program. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sec. 709 requires DOD to provide reimbursement for applied behavior analysis (used in the treatment of autism spectrum disorder) at rates not lower than the rates in effect on May 1, 2023. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sec. 716 nullifies an October 20, 2022, DOD memorandum titled &lt;em&gt;Ensuring Access to Reproductive Health Services&lt;/em&gt; and prohibits the expenditure of funds to carry out the memorandum or any successor memorandum. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;(The memorandum directs DOD to take certain actions, such as (1) establishing additional privacy protections for reproductive health care information; (2) developing a program to support DOD health care providers facing penalties, including criminal penalties, for appropriately performing their medical duties; and (3) establishing travel and transportation allowances for servicemembers and their dependents to access certain reproductive health care that is unavailable locally.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This section also prohibits DOD from paying or reimbursing any fees or expenses relating to a health care professional gaining a license in a state if the purpose of gaining such a license is to provide abortion services. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sec. 717 prohibits TRICARE from providing sex reassignment surgeries or hormone treatments for the purpose of gender alteration of a transgender individual. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sec. 729 requires DOD to establish a task force to examine matters relating to the mental health of members of the armed forces. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sec. 736 prohibits DOD from requiring individuals to wear masks on military bases inside the United States to prevent the spread of COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For additional information see&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IN/IN12215"&gt;CRS Insight IN12215, &lt;em&gt;FY2024 NDAA: TRICARE for Reservists&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and&amp;nbsp; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IN/IN12203"&gt;CRS Insight IN12203,&lt;em&gt; FY2024 NDAA: TRICARE Coverage of Gender-Affirming Care&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;TITLE VIII--ACQUISITION POLICY, ACQUISITION MANAGEMENT, AND RELATED MATTERS&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This title sets policy regarding acquisitions and acquisition management, general contracting authorities, domestic sourcing requirements, accelerated acquisition programs, industrial base matters, and small businesses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Below&amp;nbsp;are some examples of provisions in this title.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sec. 834 expands requirements to provide certain cost and pricing data, which currently apply to certain contracts where only one&amp;nbsp;bid is expected, to also&amp;nbsp;apply to&amp;nbsp;certain cost-reimbursement contracts. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sec. 851 requires DOD to establish a pilot program to conduct competitions to acquire attritable systems to solve urgent operational needs. The section defines&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;attritable systems&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;as systems, such as unmanned systems, that are purpose-designed, potentially reusable, suitable for integration by digital means, and affordable to allow risk of loss. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sec. 852 requires DOD to establish a program to develop and field capabilities that reduce operational risk when adversaries directly target military logistics. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sec. 853 requires DOD to establish a public-private partnership pilot program to provide incentives (including loan guarantees) to invest in small or nontraditional defense contractors to accelerate the scaling, production, and acquisition of advanced capabilities for national security. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For additional information see&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IN/IN12225"&gt;CRS Insight IN12225, &lt;em&gt;FY2024 NDAA: Department of Defense Acquisition Policy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and&amp;nbsp; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IN/IN12221"&gt;CRS Insight IN12221, &lt;em&gt;FY2024 NDAA: Defense Industrial Base Policy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;TITLE IX--DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This title sets policy regarding the Office of the Secretary of Defense and DOD organization and management. &lt;strike&gt;&lt;/strike&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Below&amp;nbsp;are some examples of provisions in this title.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sec. 902 eliminates the position of Director of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (CAPE). (The CAPE Director serves as the principal advisor to the Secretary of Defense and other senior defense officials on a variety of topics including independent cost assessment, program evaluation, and analysis of alternatives.) DOD&amp;nbsp;must reassign the CAPE Director's responsibilities to&amp;nbsp;another DOD officer or employee.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This section also eliminates the positions of Deputy Director for Cost Assessment and Deputy Director for Program Evaluation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sec. 904 eliminates the position of Chief Diversity Officer of DOD and the positions of Senior Advisor for Diversity and Inclusion in each of the military departments. This section also (1) prohibits funding to establish a similar position; (2) prohibits any new positions within DOD related to diversity, equity, and inclusion; and (3) filling any vacancies in DOD with responsibility for such matters. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sec. 923 adds the Chief of the National Guard Bureau to the group of senior military officers eligible to serve as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sec. 925 provides statutory authority for the Defense Innovation Unit within DOD. The unit's duties include identifying and supporting the development of commercial technologies that could potentially be implemented within DOD. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This section also establishes a Nontraditional Innovation Fielding Enterprise (NIFE). The purpose of the NIFE is to streamline efforts to develop, procure, and field needed capabilities using commercial innovation and external capital. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sec. 951 establishes a Space National Guard as part of the organized militia in the states, territories, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia in which the Space Force operates or where there is significant space launch or mission control capabilities. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;TITLE X--GENERAL PROVISIONS&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This title sets policy in various areas, including financial matters, counterdrug activity, naval vessels and shipyards, and counterterrorism.&lt;strike&gt;&lt;/strike&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Below&amp;nbsp;are some examples of provisions in this title.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sec. 1006 modifies a DOD program that provides funding assistance for procuring equipment for National Guard drug interdiction and counterdrug activities. Specifically, the section increases the maximum amount of assistance available for each item procured. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sec. 1009 requires DOD, with the concurrence of the Department of State, to develop a strategy to target, disrupt, or degrade threats to national security caused by fentanyl trafficking. This section also requires DOD to seek enhanced cooperation with Mexican defense officials to target, disrupt, or degrade transnational crime organizations in Mexico that traffic fentanyl. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sec. 1031 extends through December 31, 2024, an existing prohibition on the use of DOD funds for the transfer or release of individuals detained at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sec. 1042 limits the circumstances under which DOD may waive a prohibition on providing funds to an institute of higher education that hosts a Confucius Institute, and prohibits any such waiver after October 1, 2026.

(China claims sovereignty over Taiwan, which is self-ruled. China has proposed reunification with Taiwan under a &lt;i&gt;One Country, Two Systems&lt;/i&gt; approach, where Taiwan would be under China's central government but have "a high degree of autonomy," as described by China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sec. 1313 prohibits using funds made available to DOD for FY2024 to support any work performed by EcoHealth Alliance, Inc., in China on research supported by the Chinese government. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For additional information see&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF12303"&gt;CRS In Focus IF12303, &lt;em&gt;The Pacific Deterrence Initiative: A Budgetary Overview&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF12481"&gt;CRS In Focus IF12481, &lt;i&gt;Taiwan: Defense and Military Issues&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF10275"&gt;CRS In Focus &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF10275"&gt;IF10275, &lt;i&gt;Taiwan: Political and Security Issues&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;TITLE XIV--OTHER AUTHORIZATIONS&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This title authorizes appropriations for specified working capital and revolving funds and for other programs, including chemical agents and munitions destruction, drug interdiction and counterdrug activities, and the defense health program.

Specifically, DOD must base its national emergency planning assumptions on certain scenarios requiring the total mobilization of the U.S. economy for&amp;nbsp;a sustained conventional global war of at least two to three years. (The National Defense Stockpile was established by Congress in 1939 to acquire and retain strategic and critical materials to decrease or prevent the potential dependence of the United States on foreign sources for supplies of these materials in times of national emergency.) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sec. 1412 adds a senior Coast Guard official to the Strategic and Critical Materials Board of Directors, only&amp;nbsp;for matters of the board relating to the Coast Guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;TITLE XV--CYBERSPACE-RELATED MATTERS&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This title sets policy on cyberspace-related matters.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Below&amp;nbsp;are some examples of provisions in this title.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sec. 1504 provides statutory authority to the U.S. Cyber Command to establish a program, or augment an existing program, to distribute tools for the analysis of the deep web and dark web to the U.S. military's combatant commands.

The section also modifies procedures for employees and contractors to report such complaints or information directly to Congress.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sec. 603 modifies provisions relating to determining whether an adverse security clearance (or access) determination was reprisal for whistleblowing activity. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For example, this section raises the standard of proof that the agency must meet to raise the defense that it would have made the adverse security clearance determination even without the whistleblowing activity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The section also amends the statute to explicitly state that circumstantial evidence may be used to establish that the whistleblowing activity was a contributing factor in the adverse security determination, and provides examples of such circumstantial evidence. &lt;p&gt;TITLE VII--CLASSIFICATION REFORM&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This title sets policy with regards to classified information.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Subtitle A--Classification Reform Act of 2023&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Classification Reform Act of 2023&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This subtitle requires the President to take certain actions related to classifying information, including by narrowing exemptions to rules that require the automatic declassification of certain information.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sec. 703 provides statutory authority for the President to protect national security information from unauthorized disclosure. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The section also requires the President to establish categories of classified information and procedures to both classify and declassify such information. Such procedures must meet certain requirements, such as narrowing the criteria for classification and providing for narrower exemptions from automatic declassification than &lt;a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/executive-order-classified-national-security-information"&gt;Executive Order 13526&lt;/a&gt;, which currently controls classified national security information.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Executive Order 13526 shall remain in effect until superseded by the procedures required by this section. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sec. 704 requires certain federal agencies (including the Department of Justice, the Department of Defense, and the Central Intelligence Agency) to designate at least one senior officer to serve as the principal advisor for identifying records of significant public interest and prioritizing review of such records to facilitate public disclosure in redacted or unredacted form. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Subtitle B--Sensible Classification Act of 2023&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sensible Classification Act of 2023&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This subtitle provides statutory authority with regards to requirements pertaining to classifying information, including who is authorized to classify information originally (that is, in the first instance).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sec. 714 establishes under statute that only certain individuals have the authority to classify information in the first instance, such as the President, the Vice President when exercising executive authority, and certain other officials who have been delegated such authority. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The section also establishes statutory limits and requirements related to the delegation of such authority. For example, the section establishes that delegation of such authority must be limited to the minimum required to administer this section. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Under this section, individuals designated with such authority must receive training on safeguarding classified information and sanctions that may be applied to those who fail to protect classified information from unauthorized disclosure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Sec. 715 requires executive branch agencies to review and process records for declassification and release if the records are over 25 years old and responsive to certain requests for information (such as a request under the Freedom of Information Act). Furthermore, the section requires executive branch agencies to conduct training for employees with classification authority to promote classification at the minimum level sufficient to protect U.S. national security and discourage overclassification.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;TITLE VIII--SECURITY CLEARANCE AND TRUSTED WORKFORCE&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This title sets policy with regards to personnel vetting and security clearances. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Below are some examples of provisions in this title.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sec. 801 requires the ODNI to submit a review to Congress on the extent to which the intelligence community can use information technology services shared among the intelligence community for personnel vetting, including with respect to human resources, suitability, and security.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sec. 802 requires the Security Executive Agent and the Suitability and Credentialing Executive Agent to establish timeliness performance standards for processing personnel vetting trust determinations. (Trust determinations include determinations about suitability, fitness, and eligibility for access to classified information). The section also authorizes the ODNI to establish complementary standards for the intelligence community.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sec. 805 prohibits any element of the intelligence community from denying eligibility to access classified information to an individual solely based on the individual's use of cannabis prior to applying for a security clearance. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;TITLE IX--ANOMALOUS HEALTH INCIDENTS&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This title sets policy with regards to payments to certain government personnel and their dependents who incur certain brain injuries while on assignment. (Since 2016, some intelligence, diplomatic, and other governmental personnel have reported experiencing unusual cognitive and neurological impairments while on assignment, particularly abroad, the source of which is currently under investigation.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Below are some examples of provisions in this title.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sec. 901 permits certain reprogrammed funds to be used to make disability payments for certain brain injuries sustained by CIA officers and employees (and their dependents).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sec. 902 specifies that eligibility for a special payment for certain brain injuries incurred by CIA officers and employees is not contingent on the claimant first applying for federal workers compensation benefits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sec. 903 requires each element of the intelligence community to implement two statutory authorities related to compensation for certain brain injuries, or to provide a report to Congress explaining why those authorities are not relevant to a given element. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; TITLE X--ELECTION SECURITY&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This title directs the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) to conduct penetration testing as part of the testing, certification, decertification, and recertification of voting system hardware and software by accredited laboratories. The National Institute of Standards and Technology must recommend entities to the EAC to carry out this penetration testing and the EAC must vote on the accreditation of any recommended entity. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The title also directs the EAC to create a five-year pilot program for participating cybersecurity researchers to test for and disclose cybersecurity vulnerabilities in election systems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; TITLE XI--OTHER MATTERS&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This title includes provisions related to Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For example, Sec. 1102 prohibits the use of appropriated funds in support of classified or restricted activities related to UAP, unless such activities have been officially explained and justified to Congress and the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</text>

This section also requires&amp;nbsp;ODNI to brief Congress on certain aspects of the working group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Sec. 7512) This section requires&amp;nbsp;ODNI to provide Congress with an assessment of certain IC capabilities (related to continuity of government and continuity of operations during emergencies) that have unique energy needs and (1) ascertain the feasibility and advisability of using civil nuclear reactors to meet such needs; and (2) identify technologies, infrastructure, authorities, and potential obstacles to using such reactors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Sec. 7513) This section requires&amp;nbsp;ODNI to establish certain policies related to the acquisition, adoption, development, use, coordination, and maintenance of artificial intelligence capabilities. (For example, policies that set minimum guidelines for evaluating the performance of models developed or acquired by elements of the IC.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TITLE VI--CLASSIFICATION REFORM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sensible Classification Act of 2023&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Sec. 7602) This section generally requires executive branch agencies to review and process records for declassification and release, in accordance with relevant existing processes to protect national security, if the records are over 25 years old and responsive to certain requests for information (such as a request under the Freedom of Information Act). An exception to this requirement occurs if the head of the relevant agency certifies and explains to Congress that the declassification of certain components within a record would be harmful to the protection of sources and methods or national security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Sec. 7603) This section requires executive branch agencies to conduct training for employees with classification authority to promote classification at the minimum level sufficient to protect U.S. national security and hold employees accountable for overclassification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Sec. 7604) This section authorizes the Public Interest Declassification Board (which advises the President and other executive branch officials on topics such as the review for declassification of records and materials of archival value) to hire up to 12 staff members. This section also allows a member of the board whose term has expired to serve for up to one additional year if a successor has not yet been appointed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Sec. 7605) This section requires the Office of Electronic Government within OMB to (1) research technology-based solutions to support efficient and effective classification and declassification systems that can be implemented across the federal government, and (2) submit recommendations to Congress on such technology-based solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Sec. 7606) This section requires each agency that grants security clearances to conduct a study on the necessity of such clearances and submit to Congress a report on the study’s findings, including a description of how the agency will ensure that the number of security clearances granted is kept to the minimum needed for agency functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TITLE VII--SECURITY CLEARANCE AND TRUSTED WORKFORCE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Sec. 7701) This section requires ODNI to submit a review to Congress on the extent to which the IC can use information technology services shared among the IC for personnel vetting, including with respect to human resources, suitability, and security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Sec. 7702) This section requires the Security Executive Agent (i.e., ODNI) and the Suitability and Credentialing Executive Agent (i.e., OPM) to establish timeliness performance standards for processing personnel vetting trust determinations. (Trust determinations include determinations about suitability, fitness, and eligibility for access to classified information). The section also authorizes ODNI to establish complementary standards for the IC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Sec. 7703) This section requires ODNI and OPM to jointly and annually publish a public report on the number and types of personnel vetting trust determinations (i.e., determinations as to whether an individual can be trusted to perform job functions or to be granted access necessary for a position) made during the previous fiscal year. The section eliminates a reporting requirement regarding the time to complete the vetting process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Sec. 7704) This section requires GAO to periodically administer a survey to a sample of federal agencies, federal contractors, and other persons requiring security clearances to assess (1) the strengths and weaknesses of Trusted Workforce 2.0 initiatives, and (2) the effectiveness of vetting federal personnel while managing risk during onboarding of such personnel. (Trusted Workforce 2.0, begun in 2018, changed the federal government’s personnel vetting system.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TITLE VIII--ANOMALOUS HEALTH INCIDENTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Sec. 7801) This section permits certain reprogrammed funds to be used to make disability payments for certain brain injuries sustained by certain individuals associated with the CIA (including CIA officers, employees, and their dependents), along with funds appropriated for that purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Sec. 7802) This section specifies that eligibility for a special payment for certain brain injuries incurred by CIA officers and employees is not contingent on the claimant first applying for federal workers compensation benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Sec. 7803) This section requires each element of the IC to implement two statutory authorities related to compensation for certain brain injuries or to provide a report to Congress explaining why those authorities are not relevant to a given element.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Sec. 7804) This section requires the CIA to report to Congress on the handling of anomalous health incidents (i.e., unusual cognitive and neurological impairments incurred by government personnel while on assignment, particularly abroad, the source of which is currently under investigation), including any such injuries potentially resulting from an external stimulus or the actions of a foreign actor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TITLE IX--OTHER MATTERS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Sec. 7901) This section makes technical corrections to various provisions of law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Sec. 7902) This section reauthorizes Title VII of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (FISA) through April 19, 2024. (Title VII of FISA addresses surveillance of targets outside the United States.)&lt;/p&gt;</text>
