<paragraph id="HD497849F89CF4B269C4426364379C1DB"><enum>(1)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">The Government of the People’s Republic of China has a long history of repressing Turkic Muslims and other Muslim minority groups, particularly Uyghurs, in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (<quote>Xinjiang</quote> or <quote>XUAR</quote>), also known as East Turkestan. Central and regional Chinese government policies have systematically discriminated against these minority groups by denying them a range of civil and political rights, particularly freedom of religion.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H02A0B6BFEF3E45888A60C6E4C38A65C3"><enum>(2)</enum><text>In May 2014, the Government of the People's Republic of China launched its latest <quote>Strike Hard Against Violent Extremism</quote> campaign, using wide-scale, internationally linked threats of terrorism as a pretext to justify pervasive restrictions on and serious human rights violations against members of ethnic minority communities in Xinjiang. The August 2016 appointment of former Tibet Autonomous Region Party Secretary Chen Quanguo to be Party Secretary of the XUAR accelerated the crackdown across the region. Scholars, human rights organizations, journalists, and think tanks have provided ample evidence substantiating the establishment by the Government of the People's Republic of China of internment camps. Since 2017, the Government of the People's Republic of China has detained more than 1,000,000 Uyghurs, ethnic Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and members of other Muslim minority groups in these camps. The total ethnic minority population of Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region was approximately 13,000,000 at the time of the last census conducted by the People's Republic of China in 2010.</text></paragraph>

These abuses include the arbitrary detention of more than 1,000,000 Uyghurs, ethnic Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and members of other Muslim minority groups, separation of working age adults from their children and elderly parents, and the integration of forced labor into supply chains.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H7AA695FA16DC49B5A6E40D04D2F3AFF6"><enum>(5)</enum><text>Those held in detention facilities and internment camps in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region have described forced political indoctrination, torture, beatings, food deprivation, sexual assault, coordinated campaigns to reduce birth rates among Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims through forced sterilization, and denial of religious, cultural, and linguistic freedoms. These victims have confirmed they were told by guards that the only way to secure their release was to demonstrate adequate political loyalty. Poor conditions and lack of medical treatment at such facilities appear to have contributed to the deaths of some detainees, including the elderly and infirm. Recent media reports indicate that since 2019 the Government of the People’s Republic of China has newly constructed, expanded, or fortified at least 60 detention facilities with higher security or prison-like features.</text></paragraph>
