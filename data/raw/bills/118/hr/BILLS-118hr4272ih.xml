<paragraph id="H10817C75008D4BD0925417E4E7514F45"><enum>(3)</enum><text>From September 29 through December 15, 2021, the DEA seized more than 1,500 pounds of substances containing fentanyl and 8.4 million fentanyl-laced, fake prescription pills. The seizures were directly linked to at least 39 overdose deaths and included at least 76 cases that involved buying and selling drugs on social media apps. Over the course of that year, the DEA seized over 15,000 pounds of substances containing fentanyl and 20.4 million fake pills, with roughly four out of every 10 pills containing lethal doses of fentanyl.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H369D748A8BC14C849D544839E53DD937"><enum>(4)</enum><text>The widespread availability of illicit fentanyl, the proliferation of counterfeit pills resembling prescription drugs but containing illicit fentanyl or other illicit drugs, and the ease of purchasing pills through social media have increased fatal overdose risk among adolescents.</text></paragraph>

Fentanyl was involved in 84 percent of the deaths. While counterfeit pill evidence was present in 25 percent of adolescent overdose deaths, this is likely an underestimate because pills present at the scenes of the overdose deaths were not always tested.</text></paragraph>
