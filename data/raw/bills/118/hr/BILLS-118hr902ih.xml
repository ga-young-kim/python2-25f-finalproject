On July 16, 2014, Ellie Helton, a vibrant, loving 14-year-old from Apex, North Carolina, passed away as a result of a ruptured aneurysm, stunning her parents, two sisters, and many, many loved ones.

While she suffered headaches throughout her life, she was never diagnosed. Ellie was an avid reader and excellent student, loved the arts, and was incredibly creative. She had an unwavering, constant love for the family and friends in her life.</text></subparagraph><subparagraph commented="no" id="H0F50159DF6A84FC09DA9376E72B4E9D8"><enum>(B)</enum><text>Lisa Colagrossi.
