<paragraph id="HB2746135A3374BDDA288B7C44EBB7ED5"><enum>(1)</enum><text>As of 2023, there are an estimated 2.4 billion people in the world between the ages of 10–29 years of age, which represents the largest number of young people to have existed in human history, with 90 percent of youth (ages 15–24) in developing countries, and 1 out of every 4 young people directly affected by conflict, violence, and crisis.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H499A017430B64BA485E13FEEA6F37C5B"><enum>(2)</enum><text>More than 1 billion children and youth are exposed to violence each year. Failure to properly address adversity experienced during childhood (ages 0–17) and youth (ages 10–29) can lead to lifelong deficiencies and compromises future opportunities for individual, community, and national development.</text></paragraph>
<paragraph id="HEAE9300824FB4685876B3743927CCCE0"><enum>(3)</enum><text>The majority of the population in many conflict-affected countries is younger than 20 years of age, with some countries having more than 70 percent of the population who are younger than 30 years of age.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="HBED23E92C3D3439BAE8A0A0C85DB198C"><enum>(4)</enum><text>Only 2.2 percent of parliamentarians are under 30, and less than 1 percent are young women. Youth therefore remain underrepresented around the world in peacebuilding, political decision-making processes, conflict prevention, management, and resolution, and post-conflict resolution relief and recovery efforts. As a consequence, youth may turn from institutional politics as they feel their governments are not addressing critical issues they care about.</text></paragraph>
<paragraph id="HA08CFFA603CA4B53A6D6E9D018654448"><enum>(5)</enum><text>When we fail to effectively engage youth, it can lead to violence, instability, unrest, and irregular and forced migration. For example, Sub-Saharan Africa hosts more than 26 percent of the world’s 52 million refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs), of which approximately 50 percent are youth. In Latin America and the Caribbean there are 6.3 million migrants that are under 18 years old, and most migrants from this region come from fragile states with economic and political instability, where youth can be the deliberate targets of violence.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="HC51A4E9FA1AA4378B723982DA9316C5A"><enum>(6)</enum><text>Adverse climate impacts, increased food insecurity and malnutrition, rising debt, growing inequality, price shocks and inflation, democratic recession, and the continued impacts of COVID on service delivery contribute to the instability of communities, disproportionately impacting the economic, educational, and security prospects of youth, and their mental health and wellbeing.</text></paragraph>
<paragraph id="HD9BBC84168B14B87A6A986F4BE10A686"><enum>(7)</enum><text>Digital transformation has dramatically changed industries, governments, economies, and societies. Digital ecosystems, consisting of stakeholders, systems, and enabling environments, can empower people and communities to use digital technology to access services, engage with others, and pursue economic opportunities in partner countries. Digital ecosystems also come with risks of increasing inequality, repression, and instability. Unsurprisingly, the rise of digital technology has had a profound impact on young people, raising new opportunities and challenges alike for youth, peace and security, from youth mental health and wellbeing to online recruitment and mobilization to online peacebuilding movements.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H475AF4CA489E4AEFB534CBCB337F6FFE"><enum>(8)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Youth and youth-led groups and movements have demonstrated the capacity of young people to play critical roles in calling for reform through, for example, nonviolent action and peaceful protests to hold governments accountable and attempt to decrease or prevent authoritarianism in their countries, by serving as a bridge between traditional community values and cultural globalization, and by building diverse coalitions that advance more peaceful and democratic outcomes for their communities and countries, including—</text>

<paragraph id="HD2E1C24A13DB46CAA29096B4222574EE"><enum>(10)</enum><text>Preventive, resilience-based, and cross-cutting youth-inclusive approaches are more effective at reducing physical and psychological violence than hard security responses and at-risk and remedial approaches, which are often counterproductive.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H67B5899BA79A42719101E675DEE2E03A"><enum>(11)</enum><text>Youth who have participated in United States-supported civic engagement and development programs are less likely to participate in or support political violence.</text></paragraph>
<paragraph id="H98D3008E7BD842648B58D5BBF172ADC4"><enum>(12)</enum><text>Youth participation in the design and implementation of community development strategies is critical for effectively reducing violence and extremism, and increasing young peoples’ education, economic opportunity and empowerment, civic engagement, and positive health outcomes, which can contribute to peace and stability.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H5C545FD6A2834304BEF7734D4B7EFD60"><enum>(13)</enum><text>Young people around the world, particularly adolescent girls and members of the LGBTQI+ community, but also young men and boys, are disproportionately affected by all forms of violence. This includes, but is not limited to, risks associated with technology facilitated violence, such as intimidation, harassment, exploitation, abuse, trafficking, misinformation, disinformation, malinformation, data tracking, and other threats, which warrant increased attention. Such risks also inhibit young peoples’ ability to participate in digital networks, democracy rights and governance and peacebuilding movements.</text></paragraph>

<paragraph id="H5E935A46F79E47FCB567D9C5CA4D5EFF"><enum>(15)</enum><text>The shrinking of global civic spaces facing youth, as documented in the United Nations Office of the Secretary-General’s Envoy on Youth’s report, <quote>If I Disappear</quote>, shows the complexity of the grave threats, challenges, and barriers against diverse groups of youth active in the civic space, taking the forms of sociocultural, financial, political, legal, digital, and physical. Shrinking civic and political spaces challenge the ability of youth to contribute to society effectively and meaningfully, often resulting in declining trust in government institutions among youth, leading to youth directing social, civic, and political participation to informal channels.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H4AD5D6B8549749A2B7F56ABE4F116B6D"><enum>(16)</enum><text>Many national and international mechanisms for the protection of human rights defenders, peacebuilders, and humanitarians usually apply to adults (individuals over the age of 29) excluding youth (age 29 and younger) due to their age.</text></paragraph>
