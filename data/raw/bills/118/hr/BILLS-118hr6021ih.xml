<paragraph id="H34CBF3F261EF4ECCBC9C370011DCCBF2"><enum>(3)</enum><text>Studies have shown that the use of ejiao is unnecessary in the production of these products since the gelatins from other sources, including plants, may be used instead.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H2C262A8066B348998DAFC7B052D7924F"><enum>(4)</enum><text>Millions of donkeys are slaughtered annually for their skins to make ejiao.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="HB44D97D03D4442C28F7D1079A1401DF7"><enum>(5)</enum><text>The domestic Chinese and international demand for donkey skins is approximately 8,000,000 to 10,000,000 skins per year but the annual supply in China is less than 1,800,000.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H18605A250F84489797C0BE19BC1F0EAC"><enum>(6)</enum><text>Such demand has led to the slaughter of massive numbers of donkeys across the globe, decimating donkey populations, most notably in Africa and Latin America.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="HBF388BFA54D84DB6A97AE4526E1CDF1D"><enum>(7)</enum><text>Such demand has had devastating effects on the families who depend on donkeys for survival, such as for farming and construction; transporting water to drink, cook, and clean; taking products to market for sale; and transporting children to school.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="HD361FFF0388A48BDB62BD8D43F102E9E"><enum>(8)</enum><text>A report by the Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organization said that 159,631 donkeys were slaughtered for their skins, 8.1 percent of the population, in 2018. Today, up to 1,000 donkeys a day can be slaughtered in Kenya alone, more than 300,000 a year.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H12A23EE83E61404ABDC8A78B76FCABE3"><enum>(9)</enum><text>Donkeys are regularly stolen and killed illegally solely for their skins.

As a result, the donkey population in China has collapsed by 76 percent since 1992.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="HC063E89EF97A41539B50FAE7FA24476E"><enum>(12)</enum><text>Ejiao companies have set up donkey breeding schemes in China in an attempt to breed the species on a scale sufficient to meet local demand. But due to the long gestation period of donkeys, and the fact that they often only give birth once a year, breeders have not been able to satisfy demand from within China, which is why ejiao companies have turned to Africa and Latin America to satisfy demand for ejiao.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="HA104B6722DDE49D6984B36ED1A801854"><enum>(13)</enum><text>A crisis in donkey populations has been met with varied responses from affected countries.
