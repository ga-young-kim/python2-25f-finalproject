One-third of the 1,500 institutions that award bachelor’s and master’s degrees in education granted 30 or fewer such degrees in 2019.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HFFF263E2B00F44B09E35E6C565F1F276"><enum>(6)</enum><text>An October 2020 survey of American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education members, which includes 700 schools, colleges, and departments of education at public and private 4-year colleges and universities, revealed that nearly 60 percent have experienced a decline in undergraduate enrollment due to COVID–19, 83 percent have had budget cuts, and half have reduced staffing. The Association predicts that, absent additional support, a sizable number of educator preparation programs will close, eliminating needed capacity to produce the profession-ready teachers that the Nation needs. </text></paragraph><paragraph id="HDD5FBAEC2E484E688E75DC648AACE6C0"><enum>(7)</enum><text>A 2015 Government Accountability Office analysis showed that only 19 percent of students who were eligible for the Federal Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education Grant program (referred to as <quote>TEACH Grants</quote>) in the 2013–2014 academic year utilized this program, yet the cost of college remains a barrier for many students who seek to become teachers.

These factors help develop trusting teacher-student relationships. Researchers from Vanderbilt University also found that greater racial and ethnic diversity among school principals benefits students, especially students of color.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H6491D049F64944B081952732BCB592BE"><enum>(11)</enum><text>Research shows that increasing diversity in the teaching profession can have positive impacts on student educational experiences and outcomes. Students of color demonstrate greater academic achievement and social-emotional development in classes with teachers of color. Studies also suggest that all students, including White students, benefit from having teachers of color because they bring distinctive knowledge, experiences, and role modeling to the student body as a whole.</text></paragraph><paragraph commented="no" id="HF5F5DBA8CB3C4FA3AB11CDE7A51DF71C"><enum>(12)</enum><text>Effective school leadership is second only to direct classroom instruction among school-based factors in raising student achievement, and principal impact is greatest in low-achieving, high-poverty, and minority schools.</text></paragraph><paragraph commented="no" id="HBBEAFA61E4804FDB9E2A49391A52A34E"><enum>(13)</enum><text>Principals improve teaching and learning through their ability—</text><subparagraph commented="no" id="H2AB4E39FF392403ABDB0FDE333D65030"><enum>(A)</enum><text>to shape a vision of academic success for all students;
