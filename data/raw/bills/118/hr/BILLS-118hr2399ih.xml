The 4/5 Battalion engaged unabatedly with an entrenched NVA regiment over the course of three days. Captain Griffin (hereinafter, <quote>CPT Griffin</quote>) risked his life and disregarded his personal safety, all above and beyond his duty, on some 20 occasions, to lead his battalion in the fight as well as direct gunships, air, and artillery strikes on the enemy positions.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H907B9F3371454604A8710070BBAAE459"><enum>(3)</enum><text>During the initial phase of battle, CPT Griffin made numerous trips across 50 meters of open ground, while under heavy automatic weapon, rocket, and small arms fire, to advise on the conduct of the battle and better direct strikes against enemy forces. Fearing slaughter of his soldiers, CPT Griffin, with one of his counterparts from the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (hereinafter, <quote>ARVN</quote>), charged directly into heavy enemy fire and assaulted a machine gun bunker. CPT Griffin continued these runs, despite the enemy shooting the heels off CPT Griffin’s boots.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HCA522C5D6E9B44AC93C55EF1528B4512"><enum>(4)</enum><text>After taking out the NVA bunker, CPT Griffin brandished the captured machine gun and rocket launcher to exhort his battalion out of the kill zone and continue the assault into the enemy entrenchments while remaining exposed to heavy fire.

CPT Griffin proceeded to carry four more wounded soldiers to safety while protecting them with his own body, returning each time against devastating enemy fire. While leading the final attack, CPT Griffin was hit three times in the chest by enemy small arms fire, yet continued to lead at the forefront of his battalion until the mission was completed. Under CPT Griffin’s command and leadership, the 4/5 Battalion continued to reduce the enemy regiment’s fighting capacity.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HF20D75B6BFDB46618B32DFF75BA82101"><enum>(6)</enum><text>CPT Griffin’s personal leadership in intense close combat resulted in a major win for his battalion against overwhelming odds, killing 93 enemy soldiers and saving the lives of over 300 allied soldiers by galvanizing and leading them out of the kill zone.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HD6C41DBF4B404284BE822C62D9906438"><enum>(7)</enum><text>CPT Griffin’s selfless devotion to duty, his extraordinary heroism, conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity, and numerous risks of his life above and beyond the call of duty, are all in keeping with the highest traditions of the Army, and reflect great credit on himself, the Armed Forces, and the United States.</text></paragraph></section><section id="HC1F958BF3C6E406F98D9EB7444AEDD39"><enum>2.</enum><header>Findings</header><text display-inline="no-display-inline">Congress finds the following with regards to the original decision to award a Silver Star to Thomas Helmut Griffin:</text><paragraph id="HC8B54C34327C46E88BFEA3762047DDE2"><enum>(1)</enum><text>When awarding him the Silver Star, CPT Griffin’s chain of command was unaware of the full extent of his valorous actions and the numerous risks he took for his soldiers, all above and beyond the call of duty.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HE9B66E5A537D419990744CBDF422F527"><enum>(2)</enum><text>Congress notes that although CPT Griffin was struck three times by enemy fire, and at one point was completely surrounded by the enemy, he continued to fight and lead his battalion against devastating and overwhelming enemy fire.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H63095A96B58445D18CD0C78E1EA610C6"><enum>(3)</enum><text>Congress notes that CPT Griffin’s Commanding Officer, Colonel Dean E.
