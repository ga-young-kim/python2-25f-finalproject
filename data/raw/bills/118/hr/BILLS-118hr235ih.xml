<paragraph id="HB4B82A86172C464498325E2909969922"><enum>(5)</enum><text>Triple-negative breast cancer is a term used to describe breast cancers whose cells do not have estrogen receptors and progesterone receptors, and do not have an excess of the HER2 protein on their sources.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H55BD4BDEB5894ECC8EF882BFD022CFDE"><enum>(6)</enum><text>It is estimated that between 10 and 20 percent of female breast cancer patients are diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer, and studies indicate the prevalence of triple-negative breast cancer is much higher.</text></paragraph>
