<paragraph id="H80F3125A77604741936D9358FC737277"><enum>(1)</enum><text>In 1986, President Ronald Reagan signed the Air Carrier Access Act of 1986 (<external-xref legal-doc="public-law" parsable-cite="pl/99/435">Public Law 99–435</external-xref>; 100 Stat. 1080), adding a provision now codified in section 41705 of title 49, United States Code, prohibiting disability-based discrimination in air transportation. </text></paragraph> <paragraph id="HB449762A28644EE28A746F5D9562C910"><enum>(2)</enum><text>Despite this effort, individuals with disabilities continue to experience significant barriers to and with traveling in air transportation. </text></paragraph>
