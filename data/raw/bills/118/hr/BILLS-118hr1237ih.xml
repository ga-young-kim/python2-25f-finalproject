Her refusal to give up her seat on an interstate charter bus prompted the landmark court case, Sarah Keys v. Carolina Coach Company, in which the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) outlawed the segregation of Black passengers in buses traveling across State lines.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HD09579EFD5104C1D91BA36B5A5C36896"><enum>(4)</enum><text>On August 1, 1952, Women’s Army Corps, Private First Class Sarah Keys, boarded a bus in Trenton, New Jersey, for her first home visit to Washington, North Carolina, since joining the military. The bus she boarded would take her directly to her North Carolina destination without any required bus changes.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H33F3EBE782604615A1D970D3B4ADD51D"><enum>(5)</enum><text>Once the bus reached Roanoke Rapids, North Carolina, a new driver took over the bus and as was custom, went through the bus and rechecked tickets. When he came to Ms. Keys, he told her to give up her seat to a White Marine who boarded the bus in Roanoke Rapids and move to the back of the bus. Tired from her long journey and understanding her rights, Sarah refused.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HA5A2AA14999A4BEFB4E6C772B48A0632"><enum>(6)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Six years prior, in 1946, there was a Supreme Court decision (Morgan v.

Because she refused to be subjected to unjust discrimination and prejudice, she was forced to stay in jail overnight and was fined $25.00 before her release.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HD568CB984EA844ADA5384388F1246038"><enum>(9)</enum><text>Once Sarah arrived home and informed her family of the injustice she endured, her father encouraged her to seek legal action.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H0D77CF72E1534985B2DF4A69721D5130"><enum>(10)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) referred the family to attorney Dovey Johnson Roundtree, a Captain in the Women’s Army Corps, who brought her case before the ICC. The ICC meeting in the District of Columbia took place on May 12, 1954. It was decided by only one member of the ICC.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H62CDE1E6EE7C407C9C55BAB0219EC655"><enum>(11)</enum><text>New York Congressman Adam Clayton Powell, Jr., agreed it was not fair that the other 10 members of the ICC were not involved in the decision. Congressman Powell helped persuade the ICC to reconsider its decision.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H426D9176B95C4056BC94B5219EC858C4"><enum>(12)</enum><text>After the Supreme Court decision on Brown v. Board of Education on May 17, 1954, and with the support of Department of Justice Attorney General Herbert Brownell, the ICC reached a new decision. A majority of the ICC members had decided that it was wrong for people on State-to-State trips to be forced to sit in certain seats on a bus because of the color of their skin and that it was against the law.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HE2A121F5272C42B9A8C2745EF3F6EB23"><enum>(13)</enum><text>The ICC decision on November 25, 1955, went further than the Supreme Court’s ruling in 1946 which had outlawed only unfair laws that a State might make, not rules that a bus company might make.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HCF73CE10AF0C46EE908C19AC1B75D146"><enum>(14)</enum><text>In Sarah Keys v. Carolina Coach Company, the ICC ruled in favor of Keys Evans.
