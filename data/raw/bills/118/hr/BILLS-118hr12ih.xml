id="HD7C6AB65A25641B7BB433C78904AFE71"><enum>(1)</enum><text>Abortion services are essential health care, and access to those services is central to people’s ability to participate equally in the economic and social life of the United States. Abortion access allows people who are pregnant to make their own decisions about their pregnancies, their families, and their lives.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H881C6EF7F93548B6AEDE3CF7FB777B72"><enum>(2)</enum><text>Reproductive justice requires every individual to have the right to make their own decisions about having children regardless of their circumstances and without interference and discrimination. Reproductive justice is a human right that can and will be achieved when all people, regardless of actual or perceived race, color, national origin, immigration status, sex (including gender identity, sex stereotyping, or sexual orientation), age, or disability status have the economic, social, and political power and resources to define and make decisions about their bodies, health, sexuality, families, and communities in all areas of their lives, with dignity and self-determination.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HD356DC10FB704259A1C74A8657138276"><enum>(3)</enum><text>Abortion care, like all health care, is a human right that should not depend on one’s ZIP Code or region, age, actual or perceived race, national origin, immigration status, sex, or disability status. Unfortunately, this is the current reality for millions, creating a patchwork of abortion access across the United States. Protecting the right to determine whether to continue or end a pregnancy, and the right of health care providers to provide abortion care, is necessary and essential to achieving this human right, and ultimately reproductive justice.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H358412B44B994D16AA4FD8A8C47AC44E"><enum>(4)</enum><text>On June 24, 2022, in its decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the Supreme Court overruled Roe v. Wade, reversing decades of precedent recognizing a constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy before fetal viability.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HBD255B93AB104E99A3ED588C4DC99C02"><enum>(5)</enum><text>The effects of the Dobbs decision were immediate and disastrous. In the aftermath of the Dobbs decision, many States imposed near-total bans on abortion. As of March 2023, abortion is unavailable in 14 States, leaving 17.8 million women of reproductive age (15–49) and transgender and gender nonconforming individuals with the capacity to become pregnant without abortion access in their home State. Within 100 days of the ruling, 66 clinics across 15 States were forced to stop offering abortions.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H755191F1693846B0A082FD256CEC0453"><enum>(6)</enum><text>Travel time to an abortion clinic, already a burden for abortion seekers under Roe, has more than tripled since Dobbs. As distance to an abortion facility increases, so do the accompanying (and potentially prohibitive) burdens of time off work or school, lost wages, transportation costs, lodging, child care costs, and other ancillary costs.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HD94446469CBE41858F7F03C8EDFBD670"><enum>(7)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Even before the Dobbs decision, access to abortion services had long been obstructed across the United States in various ways, including: prohibitions of, and restrictions on, insurance coverage; mandatory parental involvement laws; restrictions that shame and stigmatize people seeking abortion services; and medically unnecessary regulations that fail to further the safety of abortion services, but instead cause harm people by delaying, complicating access to, and reducing the availability of, abortion services.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HA252C20A5AEC477BA2044F915DA050A6"><enum>(8)</enum><text>Being denied an abortion can have serious consequences for people’s physical, mental, and economic health and well-being, and that of their families. According to the Turnaway Study, a longitudinal study published by Advancing New Standards In Reproductive Health (ANSIRH) in 2019, individuals who are denied a wanted abortion are more likely to experience economic insecurity than individuals who receive a wanted abortion. After following participants for five years, the study found that people who were denied abortion care were more likely to live in poverty, experience debt, and have lower credit scores for several years after the denial. These findings demonstrate that when people have control over when to have children and how many children to have, their children benefit through increased economic security and better maternal bonding.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HFE2DF298B04D42CFA18205B84C44957C"><enum>(9)</enum><text>Abortion bans and restrictions have repercussions for a broad range of health care beyond pregnancy termination, including exacerbating the existing maternal health crisis facing the United States. The United States has the highest maternal mortality rate of any industrialized nations, and Black women and birthing people face three times the risk of dying from pregnancy related causes as their white counterparts. Even prior to Dobbs, research found that States that enacted abortion restrictions based on gestation increased their maternal mortality rate by 38 percent. Research has found that a nationwide ban would increase the United States maternal mortality rate by an additional 24 percent. Furthermore, States that have banned, are planning to ban, or have severely restricted abortion care have fewer maternal health providers, more maternity care deserts, higher rates of both maternal and infant mortality, and greater racial inequity in health care.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HF7ACA38E565B4E16AFB88CD4318851FF"><enum>(10)</enum><text>Abortion bans and restrictions additionally harm people’s health by reducing access to other essential health care services offered by many of the providers targeted by the restrictions, including—</text><subparagraph id="H64449A126BE34FF3877814D28319BE94"><enum>(A)</enum><text>screenings and preventive services, including contraceptive services;</text></subparagraph><subparagraph id="H8B718D722AE745FDAF47EA3590AF4414"><enum>(B)</enum><text>testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections;</text></subparagraph><subparagraph id="H274137975E824F0BB6AA77FD377193A0"><enum>(C)</enum><text>LGBTQ health services; and</text></subparagraph><subparagraph id="HB264CDD186554CD19F7FCC17AC537EA6"><enum>(D)</enum><text>referrals for primary care, intimate partner violence prevention, prenatal care, and adoption services.</text></subparagraph></paragraph><paragraph id="HC8918D4D8C454F11875605E000E7CAEC"><enum>(11)</enum><text>This ripple effect has only worsened since the Dobbs decision. Clinicians and pharmacists have denied access to essential medication for conditions including gastric ulcers and autoimmune diseases because those drugs are also used for medication abortion care. Patients are reporting being denied or delayed in their receipt of necessary and potentially lifesaving treatment for ectopic pregnancies and miscarriage management because of the newfound legal risks facing providers.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H1F0EFE1C5DC0498DA73A505AD6BFB110"><enum>(12)</enum><text>Reproductive justice seeks to address restrictions on reproductive health, including abortion, that perpetuate systems of oppression, lack of bodily autonomy, white supremacy, and anti-Black racism. This violent legacy has manifested in policies including enslavement, rape, and experimentation on Black women; forced sterilizations, medical experimentation on low-income women’s reproductive systems; and the forcible removal of Indigenous children. Access to equitable reproductive health care, including abortion services, has always been deficient in the United States for Black, Indigenous, Latina/x, Asian American and Pacific Islander, and People of Color (BIPOC) and their families.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H05C5CE2E58B54A0AABFE2835D3B1EEA3"><enum>(13)</enum><text>The legacy of restrictions on reproductive health, rights, and justice is not a dated vestige of a dark history. Data show the harms of abortion-specific restrictions fall especially heavily on people with low incomes, people of color, immigrants, young people, people with disabilities, and those living in rural and other medically underserved areas. Abortion bans and restrictions are compounded further by the ongoing criminalization of people who are pregnant, including those who are incarcerated, living with HIV, or with substance-use disorders. These populations already experience health disparities due to social, political, and environmental inequities, and restrictions on abortion services exacerbate these harms. Removing bans and restrictions on abortion services would constitute one important step on the path toward realizing reproductive justice by ensuring that the full range of reproductive health care is accessible to all who need it.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H5E8F0D1909E4433DAEF51F4C82DC7254"><enum>(14)</enum><text>Abortion bans and restrictions are tools of gender oppression, as they target health care services that are used primarily by women. These paternalistic bans and restrictions rely on and reinforce harmful stereotypes about gender roles and women’s decisionmaking, undermining their ability to control their own lives and well-being.

Such abortion-specific restrictions, as well as broader State bans, conflict with medical standards and are not supported by the recommendations and guidelines issued by leading reproductive health care professional organizations including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Society of Family Planning, the National Abortion Federation, the World Health Organization, and others.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H56759911AE4B43399279A8CAF5B22A5E"><enum>(21)</enum><text>For over 20 years, medication abortion care has been available in the United States as a safe, effective, Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatment to end an early pregnancy.

The Committee stated that governments must not impose restrictions on abortion which subject women and girls to physical or mental pain or suffering, discriminate against them, arbitrarily interfere with their privacy, or place them at risk of undertaking unsafe abortions. The Committee stated that governments should not apply criminal sanctions to women and girls who undergo abortion or to medical service providers who assist them in doing so.
