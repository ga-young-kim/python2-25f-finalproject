Only 12 States require other physicians, coroners, or emergency rooms to report complications or deaths for investigation, and frequently these facilities and physicians are unaware of these reporting requirements.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HB4FD5F773B214EAEB286513787938BB4"><enum>(5)</enum><text>These data problems are a significant limitation to United States studies on abortion complications.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HE6A7242B3FC5442A840A62F893F8940B"><enum>(6)</enum><text>Women experiencing complications will often present to an emergency room rather than return to the abortion provider, and researchers frequently ignore the difficulty in obtaining accurate International Classification of Diseases coding in emergency rooms due to search engine failure to discover induced abortion codes, which leads to miscoding and frequently attributing induced abortion complications to spontaneous abortions.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H353CEDF791F348BF96411E628BE72450"><enum>(7)</enum><text>When compared to surgical abortions, chemical abortions are over 50 percent more likely to result in an abortion-related visit to an emergency room, and by 2015, 60 percent of chemical abortion-related emergency room visits were incorrectly coded as miscarriages.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H124A3AD84C924E26BA72EE5D1D284245"><enum>(8)</enum><text>Better quality, international records-linkages studies, and meta-analyses document far higher rates of complications and mortality from abortion, casting doubt on the validity of the reported data by which United States public health decisions are made.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HD4C729B744A14C13B2AAC863B15CE19D"><enum>(9)</enum><text>Independent systematic analysis of adverse event reports submitted to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) between 2000 and 2019 revealed approximately 3,000 United States adverse events out of an expected 185,000 adverse events based on the known and published complication rate after mifepristone misoprostol abortions. Thus, the Adverse Event Reporting System of the FDA captured only 1.7 percent of the actual adverse events occurring in United States women, the majority of which occurred prior to 2016 when mifepristone prescribers were required to report adverse events as part of the risk evaluation and mitigation strategy.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H4B888BB64DC941CDA257E280899C576F"><enum>(10)</enum><text>In 2016, the FDA relaxed the gestational age dispensing from a limitation of 7 weeks gestation to a limitation of 10 weeks gestation, and at the same time the FDA no longer required mifepristone prescribers to report adverse events other than death. These simultaneous changes ensured that there would be no way to capture the increased adverse events resulting from the relaxation of the gestational age requirements.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HEB13E83FA8E54BFE89E944394E2D7F45"><enum>(11)</enum><text>In order to fulfil the statutory requirement of the FDA to oversee and evaluate the safety of mifepristone use as an abortifacient, substantial changes in the adverse event reporting for mifepristone must be implemented to obtain an accurate evaluation of the impact of mifepristone-related adverse events on United States women.</text></paragraph></section><section id="H89099F6F1E5B4BF1B3994F1F8B17E763"><enum>3.</enum><header>Accurate reporting on chemical abortion and related adverse events</header><subsection id="H71B7705EAC254D108375A24F9E3A8DD3"><enum>(a)</enum><header>Reporting requirements</header><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">The Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, shall require any abortion drug, including any abortion drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration before the date of enactment of this Act, to have a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy requiring that—</text><paragraph id="HD0A5551851D340B088078EC7774D3D58"><enum>(1)</enum><text>within 15 days of becoming aware of any death or other adverse event in a patient associated with the use of such abortion drug, a health care provider shall—</text><subparagraph id="H7599087A8E0C4E1387DA961BF9CF6994"><enum>(A)</enum><text>report such death or adverse event to the Food and Drug Administration and to the manufacturer of such abortion drug;
