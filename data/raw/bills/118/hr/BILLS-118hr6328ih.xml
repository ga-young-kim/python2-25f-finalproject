If Black and Latino students had a fair opportunity to participate in eighth grade Algebra I across the country, schools would enroll an additional 43,019 Black students and 59,452 Latino students in eighth grade Algebra I courses. The Department of Education reported that in the 2015–2016 school year, only 48 percent of schools with high concentrations of English learners offered Algebra I compared with 70 percent of schools with low concentrations of English learner students.
