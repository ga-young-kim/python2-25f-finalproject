Among women who hold full-time, year-round jobs in the United States, African-American women were paid on average, only 63 percent of what White men were paid in 2015, while Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander women were paid 60 percent, American Indian and Alaska Native women were paid 58 percent, and Hispanic and Latina women were paid only 54 percent.</text></subparagraph><subparagraph id="HFFDF2E059B7546179E1B4DA3C56CA331"><enum>(B)</enum><text>The gender pay gap persists across educational levels. As a result, women who complete college degrees are less able to pay off their student loans promptly, leaving them paying more and for a longer time than men.

It is worse for single mothers with full-time, year-round jobs, who are paid just 58 cents for every dollar paid to fathers.</text></subparagraph><subparagraph id="HC9E7A6D261D44245A910CCD03971B92D"><enum>(D)</enum><text>A conservative estimate is that women employed in the United States lose a combined total of nearly $500 billion every year due to the wage gap. These women, their families, businesses and the economy suffer as a result.
