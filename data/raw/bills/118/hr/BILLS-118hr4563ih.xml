Under the Articles, the States had exclusive authority over Federal elections held within their territory; but, given the difficulties the national government had experienced with State cooperation (e.g., the failure of Rhode Island to send delegates to the Confederation Congress), the Federalists, including Alexander Hamilton, were concerned with the possibility that the States, in an effort to destroy the Federal government, simply might not hold elections or that an emergency, such as an invasion or insurrection, might prevent the operation of a State’s government, leaving the Congress without Members and the Federal government unable to respond.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="HEADD549C02E7469C82DC8AB5A7F40DD2"><enum>(3)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Quite plainly, Alexander Hamilton, a leading Federalist and proponent of our Constitution, understood the Elections Clause as serving only as a sort of emergency fail-safe, not as a cudgel used to nationalize our elections process.

<paragraph id="H11494AA4167740DCB3DF85CF3C3BB9DB"><enum>(14)</enum><text>In 2022, the District of Columbia Board of Elections mailed every registered voter a ballot for the November general election. Voters were still allowed to vote in person. The Board mailed 508,543 ballots, and 87,921 were undeliverable. The rate of undeliverable ballots mailed out for the general election in 2022 was seventeen percent, an increase of about six basis points from the 2020 election. In addition, the District of Columbia mailed over 500 voters an incorrect ballot. At the time of the 2022 election, the COVID–19 pandemic was largely over, allowing voters to vote in person without issue, unlike during the 2020 election.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="HE6A5DCB76A6D4D10B13C136F83882310"><enum>(15)</enum><text>Despite mailing every registered voter a ballot in the 2022 midterm election, the District of Columbia had far lower voter turnout rates than states like Florida, Georgia, and Ohio. In 2022, the District of Columbia reported roughly 40 percent turnout while Florida reported 54 percent, Ohio reported 52 percent, and Georgia reported roughly 57 percent.</text></paragraph>
<paragraph id="H589D89FBF918438888BF2B6386AEA4DF"><enum>(16)</enum><text>The Local Resident Voting Rights Amendment Act of 2022 allows noncitizen green-card holders and illegal aliens to cast a ballot in local races, as long as the non-citizen voter is at least eighteen years of age and has resided in the District of Columbia for thirty days. The law will take effect in 2024. Estimates as to the number of non-citizens of voting age living in the District of Columbia range from 21,000 to 42,000, potentially half of whom are illegal aliens. Even according to the low estimates, there are more than enough non-citizens of voting age living in the District of Columbia to impact election outcomes in some wards. </text></paragraph> <paragraph id="HA8BDAA9DBF5A4723A753B1D7C0B12A10"><enum>(17)</enum><text>On February 9, 2023, the U.S. House of Representatives, by a vote of 260 to 162, passed H.J.
