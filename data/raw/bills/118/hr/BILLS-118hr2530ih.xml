for Healthcare Research and Quality study that concluded increases in nurse staffing and skill mix lead to improved quality and reduced length of stay at no additional cost.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H45D8993642594EA0ABA559A96586BE63"><enum>(5)</enum><text>Requirements for direct care registered nurse staffing ratios will help address the registered nurse

by inadequate staffing.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H2F77917D2E4146A5BCE579CA00E92794"><enum>(6)</enum><text>Establishing adequate minimum direct care registered nurse-to-patient ratios that take
