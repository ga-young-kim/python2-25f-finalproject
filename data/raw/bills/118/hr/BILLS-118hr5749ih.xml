<paragraph id="HC3AC9278FD4B46D283D74396F4B81A15"><enum>(1)</enum><text>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2020 nearly 25,300,000 people in the United States had been diagnosed with asthma, including an estimated 4,200,000 children.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H95738FB525F74AB29AF8808213F9FC47"><enum>(2)</enum><text>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, asthma is more common among Black Americans, Native individuals (American Indians/Alaska Natives), Puerto Ricans, and people of multiple races compared to non-Hispanic white individuals.</text></paragraph>
<paragraph id="H00325E89AF8A4DB1AF99A483735A0A98"><enum>(3)</enum><text>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, among children, males have higher rates of asthma than females, and in adults, women have higher rates of asthma than men. Individuals living below the poverty threshold also had significantly higher rates of asthma in 2020 than individuals living above the poverty threshold.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H290D73C82A8B4087828A432997BB81FC"><enum>(4)</enum><text>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2020 more than 4,100 people in the United States died from asthma. The rate of mortality from asthma is higher among African Americans and women.</text></paragraph>
<paragraph id="HBAE285B288664C8CAF6F8AB88772A47A"><enum>(5)</enum><text>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that asthma accounted for approximately 183,000 hospitalizations and 1,600,000 visits to hospital emergency departments in 2016.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H45290AB803DE493D8022C76E7877EF67"><enum>(6)</enum><text>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the annual cost of asthma to the United States is approximately $81,900,000,000, including $3,000,000,000 in indirect costs from missed days of school and work.</text></paragraph>
<paragraph id="HED57E78057ED4BFA8A011EDEF427288E"><enum>(7)</enum><text>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 7,900,000 school days and 10,900,000 workdays are missed annually as a result of asthma.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H64A4D96DF5E947808D00CA91BD3A7C58"><enum>(8)</enum><text>Asthma episodes can be triggered by both outdoor air pollution and indoor air pollution, including pollutants such as cigarette smoke and combustion by-products. Asthma episodes can also be triggered by indoor allergens such as animal dander, mold, cockroaches, and rodents, and outdoor allergens such as pollen.</text></paragraph>
<paragraph id="H7B25954D038A42FAA8569C5DE472731D"><enum>(9)</enum><text>Public health interventions and medical care in accordance with existing guidelines have been proven effective in the treatment and management of asthma. Better asthma management could reduce the numbers of emergency department visits and hospitalizations due to asthma. Studies published in medical journals, including the Journal of Asthma and The Journal of Pediatrics, have shown that better asthma management results in improved asthma outcomes at a lower cost. However, research published in Preventing Chronic Disease has shown gaps in consistent and comprehensive coverage of guidelines-based asthma care across State Medicaid programs.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="HEE26DAEE3DD04D599EB5D243AC086CC5"><enum>(10)</enum><text>The high health and financial burden caused by asthma underscores the importance of adherence to the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Guidelines of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. Increasing adherence to guidelines-based care and resulting patient management practices will enhance the quality of life for patients with asthma and decrease asthma-related morbidity and mortality.</text></paragraph>
<paragraph id="HB8C5F2AFB02D43EEB4B55EAFB3E33429"><enum>(11)</enum><text>In 2016, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that less than half of people with asthma reported receiving self-management training for their asthma. More education about triggers, proper treatment, and asthma management methods is needed.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H97E4FBF8340A422EB7B322998A542A50"><enum>(12)</enum><text>27 States do not receive funding through the National Asthma Control Program of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Without this funding, State health departments have a limited capacity to improve the reach, quality, effectiveness and sustainability of asthma control services, conduct comprehensive adult and pediatric surveillance, and to reduce asthma morbidity, mortality, and disparities.</text></paragraph>
<paragraph id="H74DF5B22A13E48A1B4B216638F58987F"><enum>(13)</enum><text>The alarming rise in the prevalence of asthma, its adverse effect on school attendance and productivity, and its cost for hospitalizations and emergency room visits, highlight the importance of public health interventions, including increasing awareness of asthma as a chronic illness, its symptoms, the role of both indoor and outdoor environmental factors that exacerbate the disease, and other factors that affect its exacerbations and severity. The goals of the Federal Government and its partners in the nonprofit and private sectors should include reducing the number and severity of asthma attacks, asthma’s financial burden, and the health disparities associated with asthma.</text></paragraph></section> <section id="H96BCFC7EFA5F47EFB509E44C55ADB8EF"><enum>3.</enum><header>Asthma-related activities of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</header><text display-inline="no-display-inline">Section 317I of the Public Health Service Act (<external-xref legal-doc="usc" parsable-cite="usc/42/247b-10">42 U.S.C. 247b–10</external-xref>) is amended to read as follows:</text>
