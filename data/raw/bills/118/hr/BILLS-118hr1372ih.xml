Many United States citizens perceived the importance of this war and the severe impact Nazism and Fascism could have on the American way of life. Therefore, prior to the United States entry into the conflict and indeed throughout WWII these patriots independently crossed the border into Canada and entered Canadian and British Armed Forces recruiting offices or sought out representatives based in major United States municipalities and elsewhere.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HFA0A17B3B4C44E29B9EC6D32CCCFA3DB"><enum>(2)</enum><text>When the <quote>United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland</quote> and the <quote>British Commonwealth of Nations</quote> were drawn into WWII after Germany invaded Poland in 1939, the Canadian and British Air Forces made a concerted effort to recruit Americans.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HCEC32FB7A59E44F3B44D423F11CAF6BC"><enum>(3)</enum><text>It is documented that thousands of Americans joined the Canadian and British Armed Forces, a large percentage joining the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) alone. In a 1942 film Air Marshal William Avery <quote>Billy</quote> Bishop, an organizer and promoter of the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan (BCATP) and Director of the Royal Canadian Air Force, recognized the <quote>gallant lads from the United States who have come up here to help and serve with us</quote>. Notably, many Americans were also recruited and processed through Canada before being assigned to or detached for the purpose of Royal Air Force (RAF) service.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H2C124BC08535439191FFCDB934DEDFE9"><enum>(4)</enum><text>General of the Army, Army of the United States, Dwight D. Eisenhower, the former Supreme Allied Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force, referenced, in a speech on January 10, 1946, the <quote>some twelve thousand American citizens</quote> who crossed into Canada with the goal of entering the Canadian Armed Forces. Although the precise numbers of Americans who were in Canadian and British service are unknown, media accounts published by Allied journalists during the conflict nonetheless detail their legacies of volunteerism, personal sacrifice, and bravery.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H0046E3EB4750423ABB912F64EB3F8A0C"><enum>(5)</enum><text>Americans also joined the Canadian Aviation Bureau, and the Home Guard, Air Transport Auxiliary (ATA), and Royal Air Force Ferry Command/Transport Command in Britain. The existence of these ancillaries enabled patriotic citizens, who were, at least initially, unable to join a branch of the United States military due to gender, age, race, health, the lack of sufficient college education, or other reasons, to support the war effort. Those who contributed via these alternative concerns were no less essential to attaining victory.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HF8B86C03B8E947A095C0D84DA293F26B"><enum>(6)</enum><text>The infusion of Americans into Canada helped to reduce shortages of civilian and military pilots in the BCATP, and President Franklin Roosevelt paid tribute to both Canada and the program in a wartime letter to Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King. Within the correspondence President Roosevelt used the phrase <quote>the Aerodrome of Democracy</quote>.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HD73FEC11480A4AFF91CB9D21DC6279CB"><enum>(7)</enum><text>As members of the Canadian and British militaries, the American volunteers served in many capacities.

The Canadian Army, British Army, Royal Canadian Navy, and Royal Navy also incurred American personnel casualties. Those who perished and the survivors demonstrated the exceptional courage that has been repeatedly displayed in the defense of freedom throughout American history.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H8455414E9E044BC687911B77FFCC3DEB"><enum>(9)</enum><text>A unique and highly publicized group of Americans, who were members of the RCAF and RAF, were posted to the famous RAF Eagle Squadrons and thereby showcased the important roles American volunteers were undertaking. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, whose mother was American, played an important role in originally promoting the concept of the Eagle Squadrons to the Air Ministry.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HAAF578BE0A754A97AE0870FDB84D6BF1"><enum>(10)</enum><text>The early successes of female ferry aircrews paved the way for the formation in the United States of the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP) in 1943. The exceptional legacy of the Women Airforce Service Pilots, ATA, etc., provided essential support and paved the way for future generations of military women.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H920B1A741A1B4DA08CE71B5871BFA349"><enum>(11)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">A substantial portion of the Americans serving in Canadian and British aerial forces transferred to the United States Army Air Forces between 1942 and 1944, while others elected to enter other branches of the United States Military.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H78285DB6C338426399B1257BF629FAD5"><enum>(12)</enum><text>The practical experience these veterans of Canadian and British service possessed provided the inexperienced American Forces with an immediate degree of competence and effectiveness.
