Employers will likely shed less skilled workers and replace them with higher-skilled technology workers, which increases labor productivity as a recession tapers off.</text></paragraph>
<paragraph id="HAFA86449758F4CF68050A290632EBECD"><enum>(2)</enum><text>The current pipeline of engineering talent does not include many college graduates from large cohorts of the population. Women represent over 57 percent of college graduates but only 22 percent of the engineers entering the workforce. Within the workforce, only 14 percent of engineers are women. Women also leave the engineering profession in greater numbers than men do.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="HF3AD4FFF6E7048CB8BBD782F011D3096"><enum>(3)</enum><text>A 2018 Pew Research Center study showed there are wide racial gaps among current STEM workers regarding reasons why so few Black and Hispanic people work in STEM. For example, over 70 percent of Black STEM workers view lack of access to education and discriminatory hiring and promotion practices as reasons there are so few Black men and women in the STEM fields. By comparison, less than 30 percent of White and Asian STEM workers view that lack of access and those practices as barriers to Black people entering the fields. Additionally, 62 percent of Black STEM workers say they have faced discrimination in their jobs compared to just 13 percent of White STEM workers.</text></paragraph>
<paragraph id="HD443FB07A35F4710814A7F2D9A45440C"><enum>(4)</enum><text>Among the 25,300,000 United States women ages 25 through 54 with a bachelor’s degree or higher degree in 2017, 4,200,000 were out of the labor force. While some of those women were disabled or retired, the remaining 3,600,000 women may be candidates to return to work.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H435AEEBDBF034D458EA3DB152367A86A"><enum>(5)</enum><text>The Center for Talent Innovation’s research shows that while 93 percent of women who left the workforce want to resume their careers, only 74 percent manage to get any kind of job at all and just 40 percent successfully return to work full-time.</text></paragraph>
<paragraph id="H13B872A8EDDB475ABF7AB0F2314F1ADF"><enum>(6)</enum><text>Mid-career internship and other returnship programs are an effective way to address the difficulties of former STEM employees seeking to return to work, as the programs provide a probationary period and also an opportunity to obtain mentorship, professional development, and support as the participants transition back to work. Even more important, returnship programs allow an employer to base a hiring decision on an actual work sample instead of a series of interviews. At the same time, the programs give participants an opportunity to return to work together, in a cohort of similarly situated returners. </text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H6C5C9774FB314FC1B3029BDBFAC28571"><enum>(7)</enum><text>Fortune 500 companies like Apple, Honeywell, Northrop Grumman, Ingersoll Rand, and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company have taken the initiative to try to close the gender gap among STEM professionals by providing mid-career internships for returning technical professionals. However, a 2008 study by Anthony Breitzman and Diana Hicks for the Office of Advocacy of the Small Business Administration, entitled <quote>An Analysis of Small Business Patents by Industry and Firm Size</quote>, found that <quote>Small firms are much more likely to develop emerging technologies than are large firms. This is perhaps intuitively reasonable given theories on small firms effecting technological change, but the quantitative data here support this assertion. Specifically, although small firms account for only 8 percent of patents granted, they account for 24 percent of the patents in the top 100 emerging clusters.</quote>.</text></paragraph></subsection>
