That is equal to roughly 35 percent of United Nations member states.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H1B4CB6B86C9147D4BEEE7F10F17FF54D"><enum>(3)</enum><text>11 countries have jurisdictions in which the death penalty can be imposed for private, consensual same-sex sexual activity.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H584E348B24D3464798C86700D715768D"><enum>(4)</enum><text>Despite recent progress made toward decriminalization, marriage equality, and legal gender recognition, several countries have introduced anti-LGBTQI+ pieces of legislation that would further criminalize or stigmatize LGBTQI+ peoples. This includes a draconian law under review in Ghana that would outlaw LGBTQI+ relationships or identities, as well as actions by community allies, and bills that ban so-called LGBTQI+ <quote>propaganda,</quote> such as those in Russia and Hungary.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H37F8902332534DF8BC50E09D083C42EA"><enum>(5)</enum><text>In anti-LGBTQI+ prosecutions, law enforcement officials, working in tandem with medical personnel, use the forensically discredited practice of forced anal exams to try to prove same-sex sexual activity or otherwise to torture or intimidate detainees. The United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture has described forced anal examinations as a form of torture or cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment and the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights issued a report in 2015 calling for governments to ban the practice. Human Rights Watch has documented several cases in which forced anal examinations have been used to sentence individuals for same-sex sexual conduct, including in Uzbekistan and Egypt.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HBD84B9D30D684525937F55EFB6334ED5"><enum>(6)</enum><text>The closing of civil society space, particularly with the increased passage or enforcement of laws that prevent the registration or operations of non-governmental organizations, discriminates against LGBTQI+ human rights defenders and is a violation of freedom of association. This includes the wrongful closure of Sexual Minorities Uganda (SMUG), a leading non-governmental organization committed to protecting and advancing the human rights of LGBTQI+ individuals in Uganda.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HCB2826953B1A412BBAF8CCB2463056E7"><enum>(7)</enum><text>Extreme violence and insecurity in El Salvador, Nicaragua, Guatemala, and Honduras has driven LGBTQI+ people to flee their countries of origin to the United States for protection. At the United States border with Mexico, LGBTQI+ asylum seekers face additional violence and many have been returned to face persecution in their home countries or in third countries that are not safe.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HB8C5A7A5DF4047C6B67B8D2807D7E0BC"><enum>(8)</enum><text>Studies have shown that structural risks including country-level policies, prosecutions, and legal barriers might contribute to higher HIV prevalence among LGBTQI+ people, especially gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men. Decriminalization, decreasing enforcement, and stigma reduction are necessary to effective control of HIV.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H72B50D9CF7734FB3B2E879C9E2EC1B19"><enum>(9)</enum><text>The Trans Murder Monitoring Project, which monitors homicides of transgender individuals, documented at least 327 trans and gender-diverse people killed between October 1, 2021, and September 30, 2022. Of these cases, 68 percent of all of the murders occurred in Latin America and the Caribbean, with 29 percent of the total occurring in Brazil.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H555AA55E6BD940A0B2F7C032C7B4C262"><enum>(10)</enum><text>Intersex people experience prejudice and discrimination, including the common performance of medically unnecessary surgeries without their consent or approval, because their bodies do not conform to other people’s expectations about sex and gender.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H609D7888E6FE46FCA6C1091BFC428F65"><enum>(11)</enum><text>Violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity are documented in the Department of State’s annual Country Reports on Human Rights Practices. The report covering 2021 continues to show a clear pattern of human rights violations or abuses in every region of the world based on sexual orientation, gender identity, or sex characteristics. These violations or abuses include murder, rape, torture, death threats, extortion, and imprisonment, as well as loss of employment, housing, access to health care, and other forms of societal stigma and discrimination. The reports further document LGBTQI+-specific restrictions on basic freedoms of assembly, press, and speech in every region of the world.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H3C5A53AD375945A184EFD50DAF48BF65"><enum>(12)</enum><text>On December 6, 2011, President Barack Obama released the <quote>Presidential Memorandum—International Initiatives to Advance the Human Rights of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Persons</quote>.
