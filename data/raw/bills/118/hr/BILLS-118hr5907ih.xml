Transnational repression is often used to silence individuals who are perceived to oppose or are critical of a government, including journalists, writers and artists, human rights defenders, religious or ethnic minority groups, and political opponents. Methods of transnational repression may include physical and digital stalking, harassment, computer hacking, phone tapping, INTERPOL abuse, criminal threats, assaults, attempted kidnappings, coerced repatriation, and detaining family members in the home country.</text></paragraph>

According to Citizen Lab, <quote>digital transnational repression</quote> tools are used to facilitate government reach beyond borders to gain access to social media and email accounts, including through phishing attacks, zero-click spyware hacks, social media page takedowns, SIM card hacks, and fake invitations to conferences. For human rights activists and dissidents, this has a serious impact on their advocacy work and sense of security, even if they have relocated to escape physical intimidation.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H92E6715DD71241318F020E65C1A5CE09"><enum>(4)</enum><text>On February 23, 2022, the National Security Division of the Department of Justice launched a <quote>Strategy for Countering Nation-State Threats</quote> in order to support a comprehensive, <quote>whole-of-government</quote> approach to addressing threats the United States faces from hostile nations, including transnational repression. </text></paragraph>

The Department of Justice has reported an <quote>alarming rise in plots emanating from Iran, China, Russia, and elsewhere, targeting people in the United States</quote>.

The number of countries where acts of transnational repression took place rose from 84 to 91 in 2022, including the United States, according to Freedom House.</text></paragraph></section> 
<section id="H3B0C262D6638476F95D17A65943B7C6B"><enum>3.</enum><header>Sense of Congress</header><text display-inline="no-display-inline">It is the sense of Congress that hostile nations and authoritarian regimes have increasingly and aggressively targeted individuals in the United States and persons outside the United States. Agents of these governments have acted outside diplomatic channels to threaten, intimidate, harass, surveil, stalk, silence, and even plot to physically harm or kidnap persons within U.S. borders. Although transnational repression often involves actions that are already prohibited by U.S. law, their foreign government backing render these activities more dangerous than the underlying acts of intimidation or harassment alone. Therefore, it is necessary to formally define and criminalize transnational repression in Federal law, and to more actively track and report on instances of transnational repression in the United States and affecting United States persons. It is also necessary to continue to work with foreign partners to address this issue in a coordinated manner, including in multilateral settings. </text></section> <section id="H189FCF46C740440B9808BBF843B7B687"><enum>4.</enum><header>Criminalizing transnational repression</header> <subsection id="H93C63F604C244336A410A26E34B4A6EE"><enum>(a)</enum><header>Offense</header><text display-inline="yes-display-inline"><external-xref legal-doc="usc-chapter" parsable-cite="usc-chapter/18/45">Chapter 45</external-xref> of title 18, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:</text>
