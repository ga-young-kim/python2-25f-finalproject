The largest banks included: The First (1791–1811) and Second (1816–1836) Banks of the United States, President Lincoln’s national banking system, and President Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s Reconstruction Finance Corporation (1932–1957).</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H440D48482224440BBE4FB88B0CE4F85F"><enum>(2)</enum><text>These national banks were enacted with broad bi-partisan support, and financed the construction of: roads, turnpikes, bridges, and canals; the Transcontinental Railroad; the Hoover Dam; rural electrification; manufacturing start-ups; and rail, school, and farm improvements in every corner of our country. Investments created the conditions for improved productivity, economic growth, and job creation; helped lift us out of the Great Depression; and contributed to our victory in World War II.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H24FC0A8A112F49D7B7474896B6112304"><enum>(3)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">The American Society of Civil Engineers (hereinafter referred to as <quote>ASCE</quote>), in its 2021 Report Card and Failure to Act Series, estimates that $6,109,000,000,000 (expressed in 2019 dollars) is needed over the next ten years (2020–2029) to meet all of our country’s infrastructure needs. Of that amount, $3,483,000,000,000 is expected to be financed by: the Federal government through its normal budget appropriations process; and by States, counties, cities, utilities, and port and airport authorities through their general revenues, special taxes, user fees, and borrowing. Even with this spending, however, a financing gap of $2,626,000,000,000 remains. To close this gap, our nation will need to increase investment, by all levels of government, from 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent of GDP by 2025.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H3AA170119CEC40F5B87C0B6C36506A6B"><enum>(4)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">ASCE further estimates that the added $2,626,000,000,000 (expressed in 2019 dollars) needed over a ten-year period to bring systems up to a state of good repair is broken out as follows (amounts in parentheses):</text><subparagraph id="H835070249C2C4801B950A803D6D96874"><enum>(A)</enum><text>Roads, bridges, and transit ($1,035,000,000,000).</text></subparagraph><subparagraph id="HACDED32970E549D99307E452C292ED2A"><enum>(B)</enum><text>Drinking water, wastewater, and stormwater systems ($801,000,000,000).</text></subparagraph><subparagraph id="HFD971D4EA7454934B441249E020AC15F"><enum>(C)</enum><text>Schools ($250,000,000,000).</text></subparagraph><subparagraph id="HFF4DE0C6A4BB49CEAC353FFEBFDF9CB2"><enum>(D)</enum><text>Electricity generation, transmission, and distribution ($197,000,000,000).</text></subparagraph><subparagraph id="HAD1821C3D4374474A14AE1696881F3C0"><enum>(E)</enum><text>Aviation ($111,000,000,000).</text></subparagraph><subparagraph id="H096AFAAA44BA400196A47AD548510807"><enum>(F)</enum><text>Dams, levees, inland waterways, and ports ($109,000,000,000).</text></subparagraph><subparagraph id="H0A1BF9B925314A6D985FA15379045996"><enum>(G)</enum><text>Passenger rail ($45,000,000,000).</text></subparagraph><subparagraph id="H8829954DA5EE4A5DA5BF4A9644BED2B1"><enum>(H)</enum><text>Public parks and recreation ($78,000,000,000).</text></subparagraph></paragraph><paragraph id="HD941332BDE7249158E75BD72CF784CAA"><enum>(5)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Expanded investment of at least $2,374,000,000,000 (expressed in 2019 dollars) is also needed for—</text><subparagraph id="H0B07A46DA21A4752B1C5F3B4309CF731"><enum>(A)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">new affordable housing ($720,000,000,000);</text></subparagraph><subparagraph id="HC57E0970B3D64FEBB594D92EBCC05683"><enum>(B)</enum><text>a 17,000-mile high-speed rail network ($1,074,000,000,000); </text></subparagraph><subparagraph id="H86ACB232BCE048E5B65A5A18C84112F7"><enum>(C)</enum><text>affordable and complete broadband access ($100,000,000,000);</text></subparagraph><subparagraph id="HF4A4C16267FE414BB9857877900144D0"><enum>(D)</enum><text>major water supply projects ($400,000,000,000); </text></subparagraph><subparagraph id="HA4FD69C38F6B42DEBFBC15933B114411"><enum>(E)</enum><text>a new grid overlay to transport renewable energy ($80,000,000,000); and</text></subparagraph><subparagraph id="H80F0281A84304B8FBDCB79A0526B999E" commented="no"><enum>(F)</enum><text>incorporated in each of the categories described in subparagraphs (A) through (E): science and technology drivers; accommodation of population growth; energy savings; and improvements in rural, urban, and low-income areas that the public and private sectors are not currently serving.</text></subparagraph></paragraph><paragraph id="H0BF39969F59848D2942CA4E1541E9DEA"><enum>(6)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Although Federal grant programs, along with matching State and local funding, should continue to play a coordinating role in financing infrastructure in the United States, current and foreseeable demands on existing Federal, State, and local budgets exceed the resources to support these programs by a wide margin.
