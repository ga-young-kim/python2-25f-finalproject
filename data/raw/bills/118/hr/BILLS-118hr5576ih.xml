<paragraph id="HC782C2656F7C47DA96715044FB05B54A"><enum>(1)</enum><text>Music is a cultural treasure and a unique source of spiritual inspiration, emotional comfort, community connection, and joy. It is also a powerful economic driver that directly and indirectly supports nearly 2 million American jobs and almost $150 billion in annual economic activity.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="HC5B5CACEAD9D4391B199DB46AFDAEE26"><enum>(2)</enum><text>A healthy music ecosystem is a fundamental bedrock for a healthy society.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H299350C8486A429EA99E704407FD91B8"><enum>(3)</enum><text>Fair and competitive markets for the use and licensing of recorded music are integral to a healthy music ecosystem.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H852D29C231EF4FCF8D9EC5DDEC3F93A0"><enum>(4)</enum><text>As music distribution has moved online, the market for use and licensing has become distorted and imbalanced. The largest Dominant Online Music Distribution Platforms use their market power to distort legal requirements and force music creators into licensing agreements that do not reflect market value. Those agreements essentially dictate a price to music creators. If music creators do not agree to licensing terms, the online platforms profit from unlicensed uploads of music anyway.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H4401929FAECD4F9B99F2A087040056EF"><enum>(5)</enum><text>These platforms game the system created by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which allows dominant online platforms to ignore and profit from unlicensed use of music and places the responsibility for finding each and every instance of unlicensed use of music on music creators. This <quote>notice and takedown</quote> scheme has been described as a gigabit-speed game of whack-a-mole.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="HEEEFDEDBAC784979B921A7A69788F431"><enum>(6)</enum><text>The trade association for the major record labels spends millions of dollars engaged in this effort which it says has grown to be <quote>largely useless.</quote> The trade association for the independent record labels agrees, calling it a <quote>dysfunctional relic</quote>.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H2109E436B0A84487869845D140281D4E"><enum>(7)</enum><text>An effort that is largely useless for major and independent record labels is an exercise in futility for Independent Music Creator Owners—those who own the copyrights and market their work themselves. Independent Music Creator Owners lack the economic, legal, and political resources to stand up to the Dominant Online Music Distribution Platforms and have no way to meaningfully negotiate fair licensing rates for their work.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H41A8DA24D3B043268E915CB4619201C4"><enum>(8)</enum><text>That power imbalance means that Independent Music Creator Owners are forced to take whatever terms dominant online platforms offer for their work. If they decline, the platforms simply ignore them since in most cases lacking access to any single artists’ work does not present a threat to the platforms’ overall attractiveness to consumers.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="HE4B13F867DD94D9E87F57808E74071E9"><enum>(9)</enum><text>This imbalance has decimated careers in music at an untold cost to our society and culture. Multi Grammy-award winning musician Rosanne Cash recently lamented: <quote>I see young musicians give up their missions and dreams all the time because they can’t make a living.</quote></text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H3A3352DA91B243668180AE9292989B22"><enum>(10)</enum><text>The antitrust laws were intended to and do provide important economic and civic benefits.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H842D7CB2EACB45078A61DC806AC15471"><enum>(11)</enum><text>A central purpose of these laws is to promote, protect, and strengthen fair and open markets, including those for music.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H1554F283DF5940868C4569D73DDE11BB"><enum>(12)</enum><text>While antitrust exemptions are generally disfavored, should the application of the antitrust laws ever be applied in a manner that conflicts with their purpose—such as protecting the online marketplace for creative works—it is the duty and prerogative of the Congress to resolve the conflict.</text></paragraph></section>
