The prevalence of symptoms of anxiety disorder was 25.5 percent, compared to 8.1 percent in the second quarter of 2019. Additionally, 24.3 percent of adults experienced depressive symptoms in June 2020, 4 times the 6.5 percent reported in the second quarter of 2019.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HD58BDE49F02547E097B0023EA1ED2E8D"><enum>(2)</enum><text>According to the CDC report, approximately 30 percent of rural adults who responded to a survey of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suffered from symptoms of anxiety or depression, and approximately 10 percent of rural adults seriously considered suicide in the past 30 days.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H574FED22F20D4477A4085E13CC7C6783"><enum>(3)</enum><text>A 2020 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that people in farming, fishing, and forestry occupations (referred to in this section as the <quote>Triple–F</quote> industry) in the United States experienced rates of 31.4 suicides per 100,000 people in 2016.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H87370B790B6A4F0386B43753D42936D9" commented="no"><enum>(4)</enum><text>Such 2020 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicates that suicide rates for farmers, ranchers, and other agricultural managers were 58 percent higher than the rate for the general population in 2016.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HD6A3D63F83714B99A8E617E776FF2099"><enum>(5)</enum><text>According to a 2019 report of the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 22.4 percent of residents in rural communities aged 18 or older who experienced mental illness perceived an unmet need for mental health services. Of these individuals, 17.9 percent did not receive any mental health services in the prior year.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HA89EF60919CC4CFABC9EAF1AFA710FBD"><enum>(6)</enum><text>The COVID–19 pandemic put additional stress on people in the Triple–F population. In the early stages, the pandemic caused instability in the markets, especially as the virus caused a downturn in food service sales and closed meat processing plants across the Nation. Farmers were left with low commodity prices and loss of revenue. This community has spent the last 2 years attempting to rebound from the effects of the pandemic. Additional resources are needed to support the mental health needs of this population.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H7BC342D591C2408596A0A4BB4A5C712A"><enum>(7)</enum><text>While the prevalence of mental illness is similar among rural and urban residents, the services available to each population are very different. Mental health care needs are not met in rural communities due to many challenges, including accessibility issues due to transportation and geographic isolation, the stigma of needing or receiving mental health care, a lack of anonymity when seeking treatment, shortages of mental health workforce professionals, and affordability due to a high rate of uninsured residents.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H5ED5FFE23DED4F33BA0AB391080CA981"><enum>(8)</enum><text>Telemental health, which is the delivery of mental health services using remote technologies when the patient and provider are separated by distance, shows promise in helping to alleviate the lack of mental health services in rural areas. Traditional telemental health models involve care delivered to a patient at an originating clinical site from a specialist working at a distant site. Having the ability to reach mental health professionals from a place of comfort, such as home, from a personal device may reduce challenges faced in rural areas and amongst Triple–F workers.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HC14F64A849BE4286BF236E9AAEDB3A6A"><enum>(9)</enum><text>A clinical trial of 241 depressed elderly veterans, which was conducted by the Medical University of South Carolina and the Ralph H. Johnson Veterans Affairs Medical Center and reported in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry, found that home-based telemental health for depression is well received by patients and delivers as good a quality of life as in-person visits.</text></paragraph></section><section id="HFE05884EE11F4DACBF2047C127BA48CB"><enum>3.</enum><header>Mental health and substance use services delivered to rural underserved populations via telemental health care</header><text display-inline="no-display-inline">Title III of the Public Health Service Act is amended by inserting after section 330K (<external-xref legal-doc="usc" parsable-cite="usc/42/254c-16">42 U.S.C. 254c–16</external-xref>) the following:</text><quoted-block style="OLC" display-inline="no-display-inline" id="HF58D9812F2DF46E9B8881BF67F9DF928"><section id="H80E06D2369FB4EDC8AD7841C31CF5C5B"><enum>330K–1.</enum><header>Mental health and substance use services delivered to rural underserved populations via telemental health care</header><subsection id="HB98445A762C344C6A9B4FF08404046C2"><enum>(a)</enum><header>Definitions</header><text>In this section—</text><paragraph id="H05F5CBEB24C34B10ACD1CF25EFAFA2B1"><enum>(1)</enum><text>the term <term>covered populations</term> means—</text><subparagraph id="HB1BFB483559C4E13AF86EC4656E0CD00"><enum>(A)</enum><text>health professional shortage areas (as defined in section 332(a)(1)) in rural areas;
