Bus stations had <quote>Whites Only</quote> waiting areas and Blacks were not permitted to wait in those areas despite the Supreme Court making it the law of the land.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HA3D7459BE0C4430BA0CB8E90D58C5028"><enum>(3)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">The Freedom Riders, with the intent to end segregation in public transportation throughout the South, paved the way for full racial integration of the United States transit system.

The Freedom Riders used their strategies of nonviolence throughout the South to challenge the region’s Jim Crow laws directly and enforce the Supreme Court decision in Boynton.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H4E6C714B51424CE1B56435CFB633D7A6"><enum>(5)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">On the morning of May 4, 1961, the Freedom Riders, comprised of seven Blacks and six Whites, boarded two buses, with Blacks and Whites seated together. Those thirteen Freedom Riders were: Genevieve Hughes Houghton, Charles Person, Hank Thomas, John Lewis, Edward Blankenheim, James Farmer, Walter Bergman, Frances Bergman, Joseph Perkins, Jimmy McDonald, Mae Francis Moultrie, Benjamin Elton Cox, and Albert Bigelow. Most segregated States considered even this level of integration a crime. At various stops along the way, the Freedom Riders would enter areas designated <quote>Whites</quote> and <quote>Colored</quote> and would eat together at segregated lunch counters to defy local laws.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H9AE963EBCD734933BE95C1655063E1DE"><enum>(6)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Initially, the Freedom Riders had encountered only minor clashes until a stop in South Carolina. In Rock Hill, an angry mob severely beat John Lewis, late Congressman from the 5th District of Georgia, when he entered the bus station. Henry <quote>Hank</quote> Thomas was jailed when he entered the bus station in Winnsboro. Authorities delivered him to a waiting mob long after the station had closed that evening. A local Black minister rescued Thomas, enabling him to rejoin the group in Columbia. However, Lewis was so badly beaten he could not continue the Freedom Rides.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HF2C1085C4A06422E894B3D4C3EA02D32"><enum>(7)</enum><text>Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and other civil rights leaders met with the group in Atlanta to dissuade their continuance through the Deep South due to death threats. Despite these warnings, more Freedom Riders joined in Atlanta. Dedicated to their mission to end segregation in the South and trained in nonviolent movements, the Freedom Riders continued on their journey.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H4A7ECB61B0A84A92845E74B884764A14"><enum>(8)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">On Mother’s Day, May 14, 1961, the Freedom Riders were on two different buses. An angry mob in Anniston, Alabama, firebombed the first bus. When the Freedom Riders rushed out, still choking from the thick smoke of the burning bus, the waiting angry mob beat them with lead pipes and baseball bats as the bus exploded. Ambulances refused to transport the Black Freedom Riders to the hospital. The mob beat the Freedom Riders on the second bus and forced them to sit in the back. As they journeyed to Birmingham, another mob savagely beat the Freedom Riders.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H47D2E427AB174291883422D75AD03EBC"><enum>(9)</enum><text>The Nashville (TN) Student Group, a local group of students who had been successful in desegregating the lunch counters and movie theaters in Nashville (TN), vowed not to let these acts of violence curtail the goal of the Freedom Rides.

This protection was short lived.

Despite these conditions, the Freedom Riders refused bail because they were determined to spread the message of their nonviolent movement.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H901DE8EEE2FF4816B869CBFA278F0AC4"><enum>(12)</enum><text>Five months after the first Freedom Riders left on their historic ride, the Interstate Commerce Commission in conjunction with the U.S. Attorney General Robert Kennedy issued a Federal order banning segregation at all interstate public facilities based upon <quote>race, color or creed</quote>.
