However, the administrative burdens associated with the H–2A program can be cumbersome and time consuming, leading to delays in the arrival of essential workers. Congress also finds that the interview waiver for returning H–2A workers implemented during the COVID–19 pandemic has proven successful in reducing administrative burdens and allowing farmers to access the workers they need more quickly.</text></section><section id="H085F4EF776F4445D93D891D5E4F69A20"><enum>3.</enum><header>Interview waiver for returning H–2a workers</header><subsection id="H8872DA924E694A919E7E8469E41F5A2A"><enum>(a)</enum><header>In general</header><text>The Secretary of Homeland Security shall waive the interview requirement under section 222(h)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (<external-xref legal-doc="usc" parsable-cite="usc/8/1202">8 U.S.C. 1202(h)(1)</external-xref>) for returning H–2A workers who—</text><paragraph id="H8152D55B708B4C6E8156AE4E0C073B3E"><enum>(1)</enum><text>were previously issued an H–2A visa and seek to reenter the United States to resume employment with the same employer as the previous year; and</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H65D02C44B9EC444091FF96D6936F6C79"><enum>(2)</enum><text>are not inadmissible.</text></paragraph></subsection><subsection id="HC2ADCB9A8A6D4260B74134730C0A12E8"><enum>(b)</enum><header>Duration of waiver</header><text>The waiver described in subsection (a) shall be valid for a period of up to 3 years from the date of issuance.</text></subsection><subsection id="H3F5702676C86492E9755C3AF502055FC"><enum>(c)</enum><header>Notice</header><text>The Secretary of Homeland Security shall provide notice to H–2A workers and employers of the availability of the waiver described in subsection (a), including the eligibility requirements and application process.</text></subsection><subsection id="HA86000F817BB464980DCCD2BB5554032"><enum>(d)</enum><header>Reporting requirements</header><text>Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter for 5 years, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit a report to Congress annually, detailing the number of waivers granted under this Act and any issues that arose during the application process.</text></subsection><subsection id="HED2C480542134B56B669239941BF71AE"><enum>(e)</enum><header>Effective date</header><text>This Act shall take effect 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act. </text></subsection><subsection id="HECAF977A942548D78614DC4A9E80C9D7"><enum>(f)</enum><header>Sunset</header><text>This Act shall cease to be in effect 6 years after the date of enactment of this Act, unless Congress takes further action to extend it.</text></subsection><subsection id="H7E6C6A328F894FCA9A36658F313E3F1E"><enum>(g)</enum><header>Severability</header><text>If any provision of this Act, or the application of such provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be unconstitutional, the remainder of this Act, or the application of the provision to persons or circumstances other than those as to which it is held unconstitutional, shall not be affected thereby.</text></subsection><subsection id="H4F6C4AC460854E5BB8F8528735881EE1"><enum>(h)</enum><header>H–2A visa defined</header><text>For the purposes of this Act, the term <quote>H–2A visa</quote> means a nonimmigrant visa issued pursuant to section 101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (<external-xref legal-doc="usc" parsable-cite="usc/8/1101">8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a)</external-xref>) for temporary agricultural workers. </text></subsection></section></legis-body></bill>
