Whichever of these weighting systems results in the highest total weighted formula student count for a local educational agency is the weighting system used for that agency in the final allocation of Targeted and Education Finance Incentive Grant funds.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H213F09CEF83140CC805616F76C969AFF"><enum>(4)</enum><text>Since the amount available to be distributed through these formulas is fixed by congressional appropriation, any gain in allocation share by one local educational agency causes a loss to other local educational agencies.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HA6264CFDA8C343C0A35BDAE93B311CF3"><enum>(5)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">The number weighting alternative is often favorable to very large local educational agencies, even if the agency’s formula student percentage is low. But because smaller local education agencies simply do not have enough students to gain from number weighting, they are adversely affected under the number weighting alternative.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H42C21843212E4768ADAA299692FDF7BC"><enum>(6)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">The Congressional Research Service has compared the funding allocations of each local education agency for school year 2021–2022 under the current dual weighting system with the funding allocation it would have that year if all local educational agencies had their student count weighted only by percentage weighting.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HF3DC39AA41E44188ADA29C4D95C23E31"><enum>(7)</enum><text>This data shows that the use of number weighting in these formulas has shifted funding from smaller to larger local educational agencies notwithstanding the level of poverty in either. This is contrary to the intent of Congress, which is to direct more funding per formula student to local educational agencies with high concentrations of poverty, as measured by the number of formula students as a percentage of the aged 5–17 population of the local educational agency.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HDC7EE84BC78E45658DC7DEB1E0F490C2"><enum>(8)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">The National Center for Education Statistics confirmed these findings in a statistical analysis report dated May 2019.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H63D608B8077F490995DC192B07C3C0B4"><enum>(9)</enum><text>Congress has a responsibility to correct this unintended inequity by reducing the power of the number weighting system relative to the percentage weighting system so that local educational agencies with high percentages of poverty but low numbers of students are not disadvantaged under the formulas used for grants under this part.</text></paragraph></subsection><after-quoted-block>.</after-quoted-block></quoted-block></paragraph></section><section id="HC86116FD442D4230B95156817E3939F8"><enum>3.</enum><header>Targeted grants to local educational agencies</header><text display-inline="no-display-inline">Section 1125(c)(2)(A) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (<external-xref legal-doc="usc" parsable-cite="usc/20/6335">20 U.S.C. 6335(c)(2)(A)</external-xref>) is amended to read as follows: </text><quoted-block style="OLC" id="H54FD118252344D87B4806D93F431A4B5" display-inline="no-display-inline"><subparagraph id="H2E8E73C8D281439A92A42F64AAC57B05"><enum>(A)</enum><header>In general</header><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">For each fiscal year for which the Secretary uses local educational agency data, the weighted child count used to determine a local educational agency’s grant under this section—</text><clause id="HFFEACFCCB184442FAC31E1F9DDEF2A7E"><enum>(i)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">for each fiscal year through fiscal year 2023, is the larger of the two amounts determined under subparagraphs (B) and (C);
