Our political system and cultural life rest upon this ideal. Government action that stifles speech on account of its message, or that requires the utterance of a particular message favored by the Government, contravenes this essential right . . . [and poses] the inherent risk that Government seeks not to advance a legitimate regulatory goal, but to suppress unpopular ideas or manipulate the public debate through coercion rather than persuasion. These restrictions ‘rais[e] the specter that the Government may effectively drive certain ideas or viewpoints from the marketplace.’ For these reasons, the First Amendment, subject only to narrow and well-understood exceptions, does not countenance government control over the content of messages expressed by private individuals.</quote>.</text></paragraph><paragraph commented="no" display-inline="no-display-inline" id="H67A202C3C7A54CBAB7E1FE86CC8FBA7A"><enum>(7)</enum><text>In R.A.V. v.
