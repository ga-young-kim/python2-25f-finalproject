services regardless of actual or perceived race, color, ethnicity, language, ancestry, citizenship, immigration status, sex (including a sex stereotype; pregnancy, childbirth, or a related medical condition; sexual orientation or gender identity; and sex characteristics), age, disability, or sex work status or behavior.</text></paragraph><paragraph

health care, including abortion services.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H83BC24D1F7E14AA1ACD394C62465520A"><enum>(3)</enum><text>No person should have the decision to have, or not to have, an abortion made for them based on the ability or inability to afford the health care service.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HAEE7C1238CE045819BC100B005D21F36"><enum>(4)</enum><text>Since 1976, the Federal Government has banned the use of Federal funds to pay for abortion services and allows for exceptions only in very narrow circumstances. This ban affects people of reproductive age in the United States who are insured through the Medicaid program, as well as individuals who receive insurance or care through other federally funded health programs and plans.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H8556843B04044382A33320CAFC2EA779"><enum>(5)</enum><text>Women make up the majority of Medicaid enrollees (54 percent) and, in 2019, approximately 14 million women of reproductive age relied on the program for care. Due to systematic barriers and discrimination, a disproportionately higher number of women of color and Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, or Queer (LGBTQ) individuals are enrolled in the program.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H8776DAB64F3D4B7CBCE5149A76A87A82" display-inline="no-display-inline"><enum>(6)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Women of color are more likely to be insured by the Medicaid program. Nationwide, 29 percent of Black women and 25 percent of Hispanic women aged 15–49 were enrolled in Medicaid in 2018, compared with 15 percent of White women.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HFF0155012EF04209AE20C273D73E8A1C"><enum>(7)</enum><text>In the aggregate, nearly one-fifth (19 percent) of Asian American and Pacific Islander women are enrolled in the Medicaid program, while enrollment rates for certain Asian ethnic subgroups are much higher (at 62 percent of Bhutanese women, 43 percent of Hmong women and 32 percent of Pakistani women).</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H8C61CC68E8014BEC81FAC2885BC577FA"><enum>(8)</enum><text>Medicaid also provides coverage to more than one in four (27 percent) nonelderly American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) adults and half of AIAN children.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H9410080BD1944B379CBC0D9E93BF20C3"><enum>(9)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">In a 2014 nationwide survey of LGBT people with incomes less than 400 percent Federal Poverty Level (FPL), 61 percent of all respondents had incomes in the Medicaid expansion range—up to 138 percent of the FPL—including 73 percent of African-American respondents, 67 percent of Latino respondents, and 53 percent of White respondents. Another survey found that 32 percent of Asian and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander transgender people were living in poverty.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HC93C454AA23F4FC2B1170D9CD0343059"><enum>(10)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Of women aged 15–44 enrolled in Medicaid in 2018, 55 percent lived in the 34 States and the District of Columbia where Medicaid does not cover abortion services except in limited circumstances. This amounted to 7.2 million women of reproductive age, including 3 million women living below the FPL. Of this population, Black, Indigenous, and other People of Color (BIPOC) women accounted for 51 percent of those enrolled.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H226D36B80BFF49B3BCA8724B3601C340"><enum>(11)</enum><text>The Indian Health Service (IHS) is the federally funded health program for American Indians and Alaska Natives. The IHS serves a population of approximately 2.56 million and as a federally funded system, since 1988, it has been barred from providing abortion services except for very limited cases. American Indians and Alaska Natives often face higher levels of poverty and limited access to health care for a number of intersecting oppressions thus leaving them without recourse for the Federal ban on abortion services.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H8DFC3A7258FC49CDB232956667EAEC63"><enum>(12)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Moreover, 26 States also prohibit coverage of abortion services in the marketplaces and 11 prohibit coverage in private health insurance plans under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (<external-xref legal-doc="public-law" parsable-cite="pl/111/148">Public Law 111–148</external-xref>).</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HAB53AD544D9842E790BAD8E73A69E3CF"><enum>(13)</enum><text>A recent report details how restrictions on abortion services coverage interfere with a person’s individual decisionmaking, with their health and well-being, with their economic security, with their vulnerability to intimate partner violence, and with their constitutionally protected right to a safe and normal health care service.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H8663BC93ACF14BC2A2C942C3ADED3D93"><enum>(14)</enum><text>About 25 percent of women covered by Medicaid seeking abortion services must carry their pregnancies to term because they are unable to obtain funds for their care. Government-imposed barriers to abortion services restrict people’s decisions on if, when, and how to parent, and have long-lasting and life-altering harmful effects on the pregnant person, their families and their communities. Those who seek and are denied abortion services are more likely to remain in or fall into poverty than those who access the care they need.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H3059BBE78E6E41D2A6F11134F6C56EB5"><enum>(15)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Restrictions on abortion service coverage have a disproportionately harmful impact on women with low incomes, women of color, immigrant women, LGBTQ people, and young women. Additionally, numerous state-imposed barriers make it disparately difficult for low-income people, people of color, immigrants, LGBTQ people, and young people to access the health care and resources necessary to prevent unintended pregnancy or to assure that they are able to carry healthy pregnancies to term. Furthermore, young people of reproductive age (15–24) are more likely to have a lower income than those older than that, and this income gap is greater for young BIPOC. More than 40 percent of youth and children under age 19 and almost a quarter of young people age 19 to 25 have health insurance through government programs. Without insurance coverage for abortion services, young people are at greater risk of not having the economic means to afford care outside of insurance. Young people face disproportionate access barriers to abortion including parental involvement requirement (notification and consent) and cost, in addition to barriers to contraception and inadequate and incomplete sexual(ity) education. These challenges, which are magnified for BIPOC and queer, trans, and nonbinary youth, can cause significant delays in access to needed care, and could ultimately harm the life of the young person seeking abortion services. These institutionalized barriers deny young people’s right to bodily autonomy and can force young people to encounter an abusive parent or guardian, ignores trusted relationships young people may have with adults other than a parent or legal guardian, and in the case of the judicial bypass process, may force young BIPOC to interact with a legal system that has historically targeted and caused harm to communities of color.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H65C24709544C4DF888A0F1A47477C7CF"><enum>(16)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">These and other government-created and government-institutionalized barriers—including the restriction on funding for abortion services in Federal programs—exacerbate and create poverty and racial inequality in income, wealth-generation, and access to services.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HCA8581BD86134D64A9D9CF594D173F3A"><enum>(17)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Access to health care, including abortion services, promotes the general welfare of people living in the United States. Singling out abortion services for funding restrictions in health care programs otherwise designed to promote the health and well-being of people in the United States has cost pregnant people their lives, their livelihoods, their ability to obtain or maintain economic security for themselves and their families, their ability to meet their family’s basic needs, their ability to continue their education without disruption, and their ability to break free of abusive relationships.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H22F1B51F1F4B4C90B6616F55D3FA6A51"><enum>(18)</enum><text>Like other health care and health insurance markets in the United States, abortion services and public insurance programs are commercial activities that affect interstate commerce.
