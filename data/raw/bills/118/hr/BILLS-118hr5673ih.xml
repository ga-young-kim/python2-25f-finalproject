For purposes of this paragraph, a participant or beneficiary is culpable if the individual bears responsibility for the overpayment (such as through misrepresentations or omissions that led to the overpayment), or if the individual knew, or had good reason to know under the circumstances, that the benefit payment or payments were materially in excess of the correct amount. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, an individual is not culpable merely because the individual believed the benefit payment or payments were or might be in excess of the correct amount, if the individual raised that question with an authorized plan representative and was told the payment or payments were not in excess of the correct amount. With respect to a culpable participant or beneficiary, efforts to recoup overpayments shall not be made through threats of litigation, unless a lawyer for the plan could make the representations required under Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure if the litigation were brought in Federal court.</text></paragraph></subsection><after-quoted-block>.</after-quoted-block></quoted-block></subsection><subsection id="H71B65F8B9CFC4EB9BF55348625857918"><enum>(b)</enum><header>Overpayments under internal revenue code of 1986</header><paragraph id="H67F6B1DC582B46A384B762141D02AC9B"><enum>(1)</enum><header>Qualification requirements</header><text><external-xref legal-doc="usc" parsable-cite="usc/26/414">Section 414</external-xref> of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended by this preceding provisions of this Act, is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:</text><quoted-block id="H2FEB0729E6F645F2A700441884FA1270" style="OLC"><subsection id="HE6E6826954C84859A5D8D10B71EF68E1"><enum>(bb)</enum><header>Special rules applicable to benefit overpayments</header><paragraph id="H5AE451EB3B874F5181ECD0EC03A99655"><enum>(1)</enum><header>In general</header><text>A plan shall not fail to be treated as described in clause (i), (ii), (iii), or (iv) of section 219(g)(5)(A) (and shall not fail to be treated as satisfying the requirements of section 401(a) or 403) merely because—</text><subparagraph id="H4260CA7DF4F74B52B0ED7C014C448F1F"><enum>(A)</enum><text>the plan fails to obtain payment from any participant, beneficiary, employer, plan sponsor, fiduciary, or other party on account of any inadvertent benefit overpayment made by the plan, or</text></subparagraph><subparagraph id="H34E1F20995554332B4360BE7B7F92F20"><enum>(B)</enum><text>the plan sponsor amends the plan to increase past or future benefit payments to affected participants and beneficiaries in order to adjust for prior inadvertent benefit overpayments.</text></subparagraph></paragraph><paragraph id="H43B26EA86D3148BB95676558E593D4C9"><enum>(2)</enum><header>Reduction in future benefit payments and recovery from responsible party</header><text>Paragraph (1) shall not fail to apply to a plan merely because, after discovering a benefit overpayment, such plan—</text><subparagraph id="HEA76530BE19E463999DF5CC9B39C1C4C"><enum>(A)</enum><text>reduces future benefit payments to the correct amount provided for under the terms of the plan, or</text></subparagraph><subparagraph id="H9E7D82128CDD4310ADE01EF75D8BC294"><enum>(B)</enum><text>seeks recovery from the person or persons responsible for such overpayment.</text></subparagraph></paragraph><paragraph id="H655DF51BCE7E4E28B6B985A7130CF4BE"><enum>(3)</enum><header>Employer funding obligations</header><text>Nothing in this subsection shall relieve an employer of any obligation imposed on it to make contributions to a plan to meet the minimum funding standards under sections 412 and 430 or to prevent or restore an impermissible forfeiture in accordance with section 411.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H571A96717DCA40A58BAD4FECABAC2752"><enum>(4)</enum><header>Observance of benefit limitations</header><text>Notwithstanding paragraph (1), a plan to which paragraph (1) applies shall observe any limitations imposed on it by section 401(a)(17) or 415.
