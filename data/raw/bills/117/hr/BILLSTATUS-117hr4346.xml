        <text><![CDATA[ <p>This amendment to the bill provides for the agreement of the House to the Senate amendment making legislative branch appropriations for FY2022, and adds provisions in lieu of the matter proposed to be inserted by the Senate amendment. Specifically, it expresses the sense of Congress (1) that the cost of insulin is often prohibitive; (2) that in 2020, nearly one in six adults reported delaying, skipping, reducing the amount, or otherwise not getting prescription drugs, due to cost; and (3) that increased barriers to accessing necessary medication can lead to lower medication use and an increase in the cost of hospitalizations and emergency room visits. </p> <p>The amendment adds vaccines against COVID-19 to the list of taxable vaccines for excise tax purposes. The amendment shall apply to sales and uses of vaccines on or after the later of (1) the first day of the first month that begins more than four weeks after the enactment of this bill, or (2) the date on which the Department of Health and Human Services lists any vaccine against COVID-19 for purposes of compensation for any vaccine-related injury or death through the Vaccine Injury Compensation Trust Fund.</p>]]></text>

and applications and societal benefits; and (2) update such plan every five years so as to align with the release of the decadal surveys in Earth science and applications from space and the mid-decade assessments of the National Academies. </p> <p>(Sec. 10825) NASA shall maintain an office within the Planetary Science Division of the Science Mission Directorate, to be known as the Planetary Defense Coordination Office, to (1) plan, develop, and implement a program to survey threats posed by near-Earth objects equal to or greater than 140 meters in diameter; (2) identify, track, and characterize potentially hazardous near-Earth objects, issue warnings of the effects of potential impacts of such objects, and investigate strategies and technologies for mitigating the potential impacts of such objects; and (3) assist in coordinating government planning for response to a potential impact of a near-Earth object. </p> <p>NASA shall continue the development of a dedicated space-based infrared survey telescope mission, known as the Near-Earth Object Surveyor, on a schedule to achieve a launch-readiness date not later than March 30, 2026, or the earliest practicable date, to detect, track, catalogue, and characterize the physical characteristics of near-Earth objects equal to or greater than 140 meters in diameter in order to assess the threat of such near-Earth objects to the Earth.</p> <p>NASA shall submit annual reports through 90% completion of the catalogue of such near-Earth objects. </p> <p>Subtitle C--Aeronautics </p> <p>(Sec. 10831) NASA shall carry out

configurations.</p> <p>NASA may establish an advanced materials and manufacturing technology program.</p> <p>(Sec. 10832) NASA shall (1) research and test capabilities and concepts, including unmanned aircraft systems communications, for integrating unmanned aircraft systems into the national airspace system; (2) leverage the partnership NASA has with industry focused on the advancement of technologies for future air traffic management systems for unmanned aircraft systems; and (3) continue to leverage the research and testing portfolio of NASA to inform the integration of unmanned aircraft systems into the national airspace system, consistent with public safety and national security objectives.</p> <p>(Sec. 10833) NASA shall establish an initiative to research, develop, and demonstrate new technologies and concepts to (1) reduce greenhouse gas emissions from aviation, (2) reduce aviation noise emissions, and (3) enable associated aircraft performance characteristics.</p>  <p>Subtitle D--Space Technology </p> <p>(Sec. 10841) NASA shall establish a space nuclear propulsion program to carry out research and development, ground-based testing and in-space testing, and other associated activities to enable the use of space nuclear propulsion in NASA robotic and human exploration activities, including in cargo missions to Mars in the late 2020s and crewed missions to Mars in the 2030s.</p>  <p>NASA shall establish a program for research, testing, and development of a space nuclear surface power reactor design.</p> <p>NASA shall carry out a needs assessment for facilities and technical capabilities required to support ground-based testing of a full-scale, full-power integrated nuclear propulsion system.</p> <p>(Sec. 10842) NASA shall prioritize the use of low-enriched uranium, including high-assay low-enriched uranium, for space nuclear research and development, including ground and in-space testing and other related demonstration activities carried out under this title.</p> <p>Subtitle E--STEM Engagement </p> <p>(Sec. 10851) NASA shall establish an Office of STEM Engagement for the purpose of advancing progress toward the STEM education goals of

coordinating efforts and activities among organizations across NASA, including NASA's headquarters, mission directorates, and centers.</p> <p>The section changes the name of the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research to the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research.</p> <p>Subtitle F--Miscellaneous </p> <p>(Sec. 10861) NASA must submit a report to Congress on the U.S. industrial base for NASA civil space missions and operations.</p> <p>NASA shall enter into an arrangement with the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to carry out a comprehensive review of the workforce, skills-base, and modeling and test facilities of NASA.</p> <p>NASA shall develop a policy and procedure for assessment, not less frequently than every five years, of its strategic capabilities, including infrastructure and facilities, and workforce skills and capabilities. </p> <p>NASA shall establish within NASA an Independent Program Analysis and Evaluation Office for independently assessing program performance; making programmatic, technical risk mitigation, and institutional recommendations; performing cost estimates and analyses; and conducting strategic planning activities, among other functions. The office must submit to Congress an independent estimate of the cost of continuing International Space Station operations through FY2030.</p> <p>(Sec. 10862) This section extends until December 31, 2032, the authority of NASA to enter into leases of any non-excess real property and related personal property under the jurisdiction of NASA.</p> <p>The section revises the annual reporting of such leases, including the estimated cost savings to NASA resulting from reduced maintenance, operating, and associated costs in the previous fiscal year.</p><p>NASA must submit a report to Congress on existing requirements for applicants seeking such a lease.</p> <p>DIVISION C--SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS TO ADDRESS THREATS TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</p> <p><em>Supreme Court Security Funding Act of 2022</em></p> <p>This division authorizes additional funding for salaries and expenses of the U.S. Marshals Service and the U.S. Supreme Court to address threats to the Supreme Court.</p>]]></text>
