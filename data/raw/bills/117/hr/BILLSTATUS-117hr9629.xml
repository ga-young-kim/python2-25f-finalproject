        <text><![CDATA[ <p><b>Corporate Responsibility and Taxpayer Protection Act of 2022</b></p> <p>This bill imposes an excise tax on large employers (employing an average of at least 500 full-time employees in the preceding calendar year) for qualified federal benefits received by their employees. The bill defines <i>qualified federal benefits</i> to include food stamps, school lunches, section 8 housing subsidies, and Medicaid benefits. It exempts employers that pay their employees $15 per hour and have less than $100 million in assets from classification as a large employer, thus exempting such employers from the excise tax. </p> <p>The bill also makes it an unlawful employment practice for any large employer to inquire whether an applicant for employment receives federal benefits.</p>]]></text>
