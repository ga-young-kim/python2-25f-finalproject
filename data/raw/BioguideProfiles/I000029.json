The State of Florida and National Issues, 1977-1993 series provides information on issues that faced the United States as well as the state of Florida during this time period. Within these documents are bills, reports, news articles, and correspondence. The correspondence is limited to communication between Congressman Ireland and other government officials. Very little correspondence exists between Congressman Ireland and his constituents, with the exception of letter standards that he used to respond to various inquiries. The arrangement of the collection, wherever possible, reflects the arrangement set up by Ireland’s staff. Of special note is the information in the Defense section dealing with the A-12 Avenger project and defense spending. The district section contains documents, correspondence, newsletters, and news articles relating to specific counties within the subject’s congressional district. The legislation section contains bill summaries, the congressman’s individual voting records, and legislative activity guides. Videos are arranged alphabetically by subject and relate to specific issues (i.e. defense), general interest, and politics. The press section contains newspaper articles denoted as either media reports or press clippings. Photographs document the subject’s career in the congress. Other sections contain information about the Congressional Classroom program, Andy Ireland’s I-Team, and personal invitations. A finding aid is available in the repository and online.","recordLocation":{"name":"Sarah D. and L.
